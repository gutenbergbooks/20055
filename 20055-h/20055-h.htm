<h2><i>THE HUNS AT ORLEANS.</i></h2>


<p>On the edge of a grand plain, almost in the centre
of France, rises a rich and beautiful city, time-honored
and famous, for it stood there before
France had begun and while Rome still spread its
wide wings over this whole region, and it has been
the scene of some of the most notable events in
French history. The Gauls, one of whose cities it
was, named it Genabum. The Romans renamed it
Aurelian, probably from their Emperor Aurelian.
Time and the evolution of the French language
wore this name down to Orleans, by which the city
has for many centuries been known.</p>

<p>The broad Loire, the longest river of France,
sweeps the foot of the sloping plain on which the
city stands, and bears its commerce to the sea.
Near by grows a magnificent forest, one of the
largest in France, covering no less than ninety-four
thousand acres. Within the city appears the
lofty spires of a magnificent cathedral, while numerous
towers rise from a maze of buildings, giving
the place, from a distance, a highly attractive
aspect. It is still surrounded by its medi&aelig;val
walls, outside of which extend prosperous suburbs,
while far and wide beyond stretches the fertile plain.</p>

<p>Such is the Orleans of to-day. In the past it was
the scene of two striking and romantic events, one
of them associated with the name of Joan of Arc,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the most interesting figure in French history; the
other, which we have now to tell, concerned with
the terrible Attila and his horde of devastating
Huns, who had swept over Europe and threatened
to annihilate civilization. Orleans was the turning-point
in the career of victory of this all-conquering
barbarian. From its walls he was driven backward
to defeat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a name="p8" id="p8"></a>

<span class="caption">CITY OF ORLEANS.</span>
</div>

<p>Out from the endless wilds of Scythia had poured
a vast swarm of nomad horsemen, ill-favored, fierce,
ruthless, the scions of the desert and seemingly
sworn to make a desert of Europe. They were led
by Attila, the "Scourge of God," as he called himself,
in the tracks of whose horse's hoofs the grass
could never grow again, as he proudly boasted.</p>

<p>Writers of the time picture to us this savage chieftain
as a deformed monster, short, ill-formed, with
a large head, swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated
eyes, flat nose, a few hairs in place of a beard,
and with a habit of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if to
inspire terror. He had broad shoulders, a square,
strong form, and was as powerful in body as he was
ready and alert in mind. The man had been born
for a conqueror, and Europe was his prey.</p>

<p>The Scythians adored the god of war, whom they
worshipped under the shape of an iron cimeter. It
was through the aid of this superstition that Attila
raised himself to dominion over their savage and
tameless hordes. One of their shepherds, finding
that a heifer was wounded in the foot, followed the
track of blood which the animal had made, and discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
amid the long grass the point of an ancient
sword. This he dug from the earth in which it was
buried and presented to Attila. The artful chief
claimed that it was a celestial gift, sent to him by
the god of war, and giving him a divine claim to the
dominion of the earth. Doubtless his sacred gift
was consecrated with the Scythian rites,&mdash;a lofty
heap of fagots, three hundred yards in length and
breadth, being raised on a spacious plain, the sword
of Mars placed erect on its summit, and the rude
altar consecrated by the blood of sheep, horses, and
probably of human captives. But Attila soon
proved a better claim to a divine commission by
leading the hordes of the Huns to victory after
victory, until he threatened to subjugate, if not to
depopulate, all Europe. It was in pursuance of
this conquering career that he was brought, in the
year 451, to the banks of the Rhine and the borders
of the future realm of France, then still known as
Gaul, and held by the feeble hand of the expiring
empire of Rome.</p>

<p>The broad Rhine proved but a feeble obstacle to
the innumerable cavalry of the Huns. A bridge of
boats was quickly built, and across the stream they
poured into the fair provinces of Gaul. Universal
consternation prevailed. Long peace had made the
country rich, and had robbed its people of their
ancient valor. As the story goes, the degenerate
Gauls trusted for their defence to the prayers of
the saints. St. Lupus saved Troyes. The prayers
of St. Genevieve turned the march of Attila aside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
from Paris. Unluckily, most of the cities of the
land held neither saints nor soldiers, and the Huns
made these their helpless prey. City after city was
taken and ruined. The fate of Metz will serve as
an example of the policy of the Huns. In this
city, as we are told, priests and infants alike were
slain, and the flourishing city was so utterly destroyed
that only a chapel of St. Stephen was left
to mark its site. Its able-bodied inhabitants were
probably reserved to be sold as slaves.</p>

<p>And now, in the prosecution of his ruinous march,
Attila fixed his camp before the walls of Orleans, a
city which he designed to make the central post of
the dominion which he hoped to establish in Gaul.
It was to be his fortified centre of conquest. Upon
it rested the fate of the whole great province.</p>

<p>Orleans lay behind its walls trembling with dread,
as the neigh of the Hunnish horses sounded in its
ears, as the standards of the Hunnish host floated in
the air. Yet it was not quite defenceless. Its walls
had been recently strengthened. Behind them lay a
force of soldiers, or of armed citizens, who repelled
the first assaults of the foe. An army was known
to be marching to its relief. All was not lost.</p>

<p>Forty years earlier Rome had fallen before Alaric,
the Goth. The empire was now in the last stages of
decreptitude. Yet by fortunate chance it had an
able soldier at the head of its armies, &AElig;tius, the
noblest son of declining Rome. "The graceful
figure of &AElig;tius," says a contemporary historian,
"was not above the middle stature; but his manly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty,
and agility; and he excelled in the martial exercises
of managing a horse, drawing the bow, and darting
the javelin. He could patiently endure the want of
food or of sleep; and his mind and body were alike
capable of the most laborious efforts. He possessed
the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers
but injuries; and it was impossible either to
corrupt, or deceive, or intimidate the firm integrity
of his soul."</p>

<p>When the Huns invaded Gaul, this skilled and
valiant commander flew to its relief. To his
Roman army he added an army of the Visigoths
of Southern Gaul, under their King Theoderic, and
marched to the rescue of the land. But the gathering
of this army took precious time, during which
the foe wrought ruin upon the land. The siege of
Orleans had begun by the time &AElig;tius was fairly
ready to begin his march.</p>

<p>In that seemingly doomed city all was terror and
dismay. A speedy capture, a frightful massacre,
or a no less frightful enslavement to the savage
Huns, was the dread of the trembling inhabitants.
They had no saint to rescue them by his prayers.
All their hope lay in the arms of their feeble garrison
and the encouraging words of their bishop,
in whose heart alone courage seemed to keep alive.</p>

<p>Anianus was the name of this valiant and wise
churchman, whose counsels of hope alone sustained
the despairing citizens, whose diligence and earnestness
animated the garrison in its defence. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
siege was fierce, the defence obstinate, the army of
relief was known to be on its way, if they could
but hold out till it came. Anianus, counting the
days and hours with intense anxiety, kept a sentinel
on the lookout for the first signs of the advancing
host of Romans and Goths. Yet hours and days
went by, and no sign of flashing steel or floating
banner could be seen, until the stout heart of the
bishop himself was almost ready to give way to the
despair which possessed so many of the citizens.</p>

<p>The Huns advanced point by point. They were
already in the suburbs. The walls were shaking
beneath the blows of their battering-rams. The city
could not much longer be held. At length came a
day which threatened to end with Orleans in the
hands of the ruthless foe. And still the prayed-for
relief came not. Hope seemed at an end.</p>

<p>While such of the people as could not bear arms
lay prostrate in prayer, Anianus, hopeful to the
last, sent his messenger to the ramparts to look
for the banners of the Roman army. Far and wide,
from his lofty outlook, the keen-eyed sentinel surveyed
the surrounding country. In vain he looked.
No moving object was visible, only the line of the
forest and the far-off bordering horizon. He returned
with this discouraging tidings.</p>

<p>"Go again," said the bishop. "They should have
been here before now. Any minute may bring them.
Go again."</p>

<p>The sentinel returned, and again swept the horizon
with his eyes, noting every visible object, seeing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
nothing to give him hope. With heavy tread he
returned to the bishop, and reported his failure.</p>

<p>"They must be near!" cried Anianus, with nervous
impatience. "Go; look once more. Let
nothing escape your eyes."</p>

<p>Back went the messenger, again mounted the rampart,
again swept the plain with his eyes. Nothing,&mdash;ah!
what was that, on the horizon, at the very
extremity of the landscape, that small, faint cloud,
which he had not seen before? He watched it; it
seemed to grow larger and nearer. In haste he
returned to the bishop with the hopeful news.</p>

<p>"I have seen a distant mist, like a far-off cloud
of dust," he said. "It is moving. It comes
nearer."</p>

<p>"It is the aid of God!" burst from the lips of
the bishop, his heart suddenly elate with joy. And
from the expectant multitude, through whose ranks
ran like wildfire the inspiring tidings, burst the
same glad cry, "It is the aid of God!"</p>

<p>Crowds ran in all haste to the ramparts; hundreds
of eyes were fixed on the far-off, mist-like
object; every moment it grew larger and more
distinct; flashes, as of steel, color, as of standards,
were gradually perceived; at last a favorable wind
blew aside the dust, and to their joyful eyes, under
this gray canopy, appeared the waving folds of
banners, and under them, in serried array, the
squadrons of the Roman and Gothic troops, pressing
forward in all haste to the relief of the beleaguered
city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Well might the citizens cry, "It is the aid of
God!" The army of &AElig;tius had come not a day,
not an hour, too soon. The walls had given way
before the thundering blows of the battering-rams.
A breach had been made through which the Huns
were swarming. Only for the desire of Attila to
save the city, it might have been already in flames.
As it was, the savage foes were breaking into the
houses in search of plunder, and dividing such citizens
as they had seized into groups to be led into
captivity, when this cry of glad relief broke loudly
upon the air.</p>

<p>The news that had aroused the citizens quickly
reached the ears of Attila. A strong army of enemies
was at hand. There was no time to occupy
and attempt to defend the city. If his men were
assailed by citizens and soldiers in those narrow
streets they might be slaughtered without mercy.
Prudence dictated a retreat.</p>

<p>Attila was as prudent as he was daring. The
sound of trumpets recalled his obedient hordes.
Out they swarmed through the openings which had
permitted their entrance. Soon the army of the
Huns was in full retreat, while the advancing host
of Romans and Goths marched proudly into the
open gates of the delivered city, with banners
proudly floating and trumpets loudly blaring, while
every heart within those walls was in a thrill of
joy. Orleans had been saved, almost by magic
as it seemed, for never had been peril more extreme,
need more pressing. An hour more of delay, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Orleans, perhaps the whole province of Gaul, had
been lost.</p>

<p>We may briefly conclude the story of this invasion
of the Huns. Attila, convinced of the strength
and spirit of his enemy, retreated in haste, foreseeing
ruin if he should be defeated in the heart of
Gaul. He crossed the Seine, and halted not until
he had reached the plains of Ch&acirc;lons, whose level
surface was well adapted to the evolutions of the
skilled horsemen who formed the strength of his
hordes.</p>

<p>As he retreated, the Romans and Goths followed,
pressing him sharply, making havoc in his rear-guard,
reaching Ch&acirc;lons so closely upon his march
that the Goths, under Torismond, the young and
valiant son of their king, were able to seize a commanding
height in the midst of the field, driving
back the Huns who were ascending from the opposite
side.</p>

<p>The battle that followed was one of the decisive
battles of history. Had the Huns won the victory,
all western Europe might have become their prey.
The victory of &AElig;tius was the first check received by
this mighty horde in their career of ruin and devastation.
The conflict, as described by the historians
of the time, was "fierce, various, obstinate, and
bloody, such as could not be paralleled, either in the
present or in past ages." The number of the slain
is variously estimated at from three hundred thousand
to about half that number. Exaggerated as
these estimates undoubtedly are, they will serve to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
indicate the ferocity and bloody nature of the
struggle. For a time it seemed as if the Huns
would win. Led by their king, they broke through
the centre of the allies, separated their wings,
turned their whole strength against the Goths, and
slew Theodoric, their king, at the head of his men.</p>

<p>But the victory which seemed theirs was snatched
from them by the valiant Torismond, who descended
from the height he had seized, assailed the Huns
with intrepid courage, and so changed the fortune
of the field that Attila was obliged to retreat,&mdash;vanquished
for the first time in his long career. The
approach of night alone saved the Huns from a
total defeat. They retired within the circle of their
wagons, and remained there as in a fort, while the
triumphant allies encamped upon the field.</p>

<p>That night was one of anxiety for Attila. He
feared an attack, and knew that the Huns, dismounted
and fighting behind a barricade, were in
imminent danger of defeat. Their strength lay in
their horses. On foot they were but feeble warriors.
Dreading utter ruin, Attila prepared a
funeral pile of the saddles and rich equipments of
the cavalry, resolved, if his camp should be forced,
to rush into the flames, and deprive his enemies of
the glory of slaying or capturing the great barbarian
king.</p>

<p>The attack did not come. The army of &AElig;tius
was in no condition for an assault. Nor did it seem
safe to them to attempt to storm the camp of their
formidable antagonist, who lay behind his wagons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
as the historians of the time say, like a lion in his
den, encompassed by the hunters, and daring them
to the attack. His trumpets sounded defiance.
Such troops as advanced to the assault were checked
or destroyed by showers of arrows. It was at
length determined, in a council of war, to besiege
the Huns in their camp, and by dread of starvation
to force them into battle on unequal terms, or to a
treaty disgraceful to their king.</p>

<p>For this Attila did not wait. Breaking camp he
retreated, and by crossing the Rhine acknowledged
his defeat. The Roman empire had won its last
victory in the west, and saved Gaul for the Franks,
whose day of conquest was soon to come.

<a name="h2-2" id="h2-2"></a><h2><i>THE WOOING OF CLOTILDE.</i></h2>

<p>A beautiful, wise, and well-learned maiden was
Clotilde, princess of Burgundy, the noblest and most
charming of the daughters of the Franks. Such
was the story that the voice of fame whispered into
the ear of Clovis, the first of the long line of Frankish
kings. Beautiful she was, but unfortunate.
Grief had marked her for its own. Her father had
been murdered. Her two brothers had shared his
fate. Her mother had been thrown into the Rhone,
with a stone around her neck, and drowned. Her
sister Chrona had taken religious vows. She remained
alone, the last of her family, not knowing
at what moment she might share their fate, dwelling
almost in exile at Geneva, where her days were
spent in works of charity and piety.</p>

<p>It was to her uncle, Gondebaud, king of the Burgundians,
that she owed these misfortunes. Ambition
was their cause. The fierce barbarian, in whom
desire for a throne outweighed all brotherly feeling,
had murdered his brother and seized the throne,
leaving of the line of Chilperic only these two helpless
girls, one a nun, the other seemingly a devotee.</p>

<p>To the ears of Clovis, the king of the Franks,
came, as we have said, the story of the beauty and
misfortunes of this Burgundian maiden, a scion like
himself of the royal line of Germany, but an heir
to sorrow and exposed to peril. Clovis was young,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
unmarried, and ardent of heart. He craved the
love of this famed maiden, if she should be as
beautiful as report said, but wisely wished to satisfy
himself in this regard before making a formal
demand for her hand. He could not himself see
her. Royal etiquette forbade that. Nor did he
care to rouse Gondebaud's suspicions by sending an
envoy. He therefore adopted more secret measures,
and sent a Roman, named Aurelian, bidding him to
seek Geneva in the guise of a beggar, and to use
all his wit to gain sight of and speech with the
fair Clotilde.</p>

<p>Clothed in rags, and bearing his wallet on his
back, like a wandering mendicant, Aurelian set out
on his mission, travelling on foot to Geneva. Clovis
had entrusted him with his ring, as proof of his
mission, in case he should deem the maiden worthy
to be the bride of his king. Geneva was duly
reached, and the seeming pilgrim, learning where
the princess dwelt, and her habits of Christian
charity towards strangers, sought her dwelling and
begged for alms and shelter. Clotilde received him
with all kindness, bade him welcome, and, in pursuance
of the custom of the times, washed his feet.</p>

<p>Aurelian, who had quickly made up his mind as
to the beauty, grace, and wit of the royal maiden,
and her fitness to become a king's bride, bent towards
her as she was thus humbly employed, and
in a low voice said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lady, I have great matters to announce to
thee, if thou wilt deign to grant me secret speech."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Clotilde looked up quickly, and saw deep meaning
in his face. "Surely," she thought, "this is no
common beggar."</p>

<p>"Say on," she remarked, in the same cautious
tone.</p>

<p>"Clovis, king of the Franks, has sent me to thee,"
said Aurelian. "If it be the will of God, he would
fain raise thee to his high rank by marriage, and
that thou mayst be satisfied that I am a true messenger,
he sendeth thee this, his ring."</p>

<p>Clotilde joyfully took the ring, her heart beating
high with hope and desire for revenge. Dismissing
her attendants, she warmly thanked the messenger
for his caution, and declared that nothing could give
her greater joy than to be bride to Clovis, the great
and valorous king who was bringing all the land of
Gaul under his rule.</p>

<p>"Take in payment for thy pains these hundred
sous in gold and this ring of mine," she said. "Return
promptly to thy lord. If he would have my
hand in marriage, let him send messengers without
delay to demand me of my uncle Gondebaud; and
bid him direct his messengers, as soon as they obtain
permission, to take me away in haste. If they
delay, I fear all will fail. Aridius, my uncle's
counsellor, is on his way back from Constantinople.
If he should arrive, and gain my uncle's ear, before
I am gone, all will come to naught. Haste, then,
and advise Clovis that there be no delay."</p>

<p>Aurelian was willing enough to comply with her
request, but he met with obstacles on the way.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Starting back in the same disguise in which he had
come, he made all haste towards Orleans, where he
dwelt, and where he hoped to learn the location
of the camp of the warlike Clovis. On nearing this
city, he took for travelling companion a poor mendicant,
whom fortune threw in his way, and with
whom he journeyed for miles in the intimacy of the
highway. Growing weary as night approached, and
having confidence in his companion, Aurelian fell
asleep by the wayside, leaving the beggar to watch.
</p>
<p>Several hours passed before he awoke. When he
did so it was to find, to his intense alarm, that his
companion had vanished and his wallet had gone,
and with it the gold which it contained and Clotilde's
precious ring. In dismay Aurelian hurried
to the city, reached his home, and sent his servants
in all directions in search of the thievish mendicant,
whom he felt sure had sought some lurking-place
within the city walls.</p>

<p>His surmise was correct. The fellow was found
and brought to him, the wallet and its valuable contents
being recovered intact. What was to be done
with the thief? Those were not days of courts and
prisons. Men were apt to interpret law and administer
punishment for themselves. Culprits were
hung, thrashed, or set at liberty. Aurelian
weighed the offence and decided on the just measures
of retribution. The culprit, so says the
chronicle, was soundly thrashed for three days,
and then set free.</p>

<p>Having thus settled this knotty question of law,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Aurelian continued his journey until Clovis was
reached, told him what he had seen and what heard,
and gave him Clotilde's ring and message. Clovis
was alike pleased with the favorable report of his
messenger and with the judicious advice of the
maiden. He sent a deputation at once to Gondebaud,
bidding the envoys to make no delay either in
going or returning, and to demand of Gondebaud
the hand of his niece in marriage.</p>

<p>They found Gondebaud, and found him willing.
The request of the powerful Clovis was not one to
be safely refused, and the Burgundian king was
pleased with the idea of gaining his friendship, by
giving him his niece in marriage. His consent
gained, the deputation offered him a denier and a
sou, according to the marriage customs of the
Franks, and espoused Clotilde in the name of Clovis.
Word was at once sent to Clovis of their success,
and without delay the king's council was assembled
at Ch&acirc;lons, and preparations made for the marriage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, news startling to Clotilde had reached
Geneva. Aridius was on his way back. He had
arrived at Marseilles, and was travelling with all
speed towards Burgundy. The alarmed woman, in
a fever of impatience, hastened the departure of the
Franks, seemingly burning with desire to reach the
court of the king, really cold with fear at the near
approach of the shrewd Aridius, whose counsel she
greatly dreaded. Her nervous haste expedited matters.
Gondebaud formally transferred her to the
Franks, with valuable gifts which he sent as a marriage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
portion, and the cortege set out, Clotilde in
a covered carriage, her attendants and escort on
horseback. And thus slowly moved away this old-time
marriage-train.</p>

<p>But not far had they left the city behind them
when Clotilde's impatience with their slow movement
displayed itself. She had kept herself advised.
Aridius was near at hand. He might reach Geneva
that very day. Calling to her carriage the leaders
of her escort, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good sirs, if you hope to take me into the presence
of your lord, you must find me better means of
speed than this slow carriage. Let me descend,
mount on horseback, and then away as fast as we
may. Much I fear that, in this carriage, I shall
never see Clovis, your king."</p>

<p>Learning the reason of her haste, they did as
requested, and mounted on one of their swiftest
steeds, Clotilde swept onward to love and vengeance,
leaving the lumbering carriage to follow with her
female attendants at its slow will.</p>

<p>She was none too soon. Not long had she left
her uncle's court before Aridius reached it. Gondebaud,
who had unbounded respect for and confidence
in him, received him joyfully, and said, after their
first greetings,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have just completed a good stroke of policy.
I have made friends with the Franks, and given
my niece Clotilde to Clovis in marriage."</p>

<p>"You have?" exclaimed Aridius, in surprise and
alarm. "And you deem this a bond of friendship?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
To my poor wit, Gondebaud, it is a pledge
of perpetual strife. Have you forgotten, my lord,
that you killed Clotilde's father and drowned her
mother, and that you cut off the heads of her
brothers and threw their bodies into a well? What
think you this woman is made of? If she become
powerful, will not revenge be her first and only
thought? She is not far gone; if you are wise you
will send at once a troop in swift pursuit, and bring
her back. She is but one, the Franks are many.
You will find it easier to bear the wrath of one
person than for you and yours to be perpetually
at war with all the Franks."</p>

<p>Gondebaud saw the wisdom of these words, and
lost no time in taking his councillor's advice. A
troop was sent, with orders to ride at all speed, and
bring back Clotilde with the carriage and the
treasure.</p>

<p>The carriage and the treasure they did bring
back; but not Clotilde. She, with her escort, was
already far away, riding in haste for the frontier
of Burgundy. Clovis had advanced to meet her,
and was awaiting at Villers, in the territory of
Troyes, at no great distance from the border of
Burgundy. But before reaching this frontier, Clotilde
gave vent to revengeful passion, crying to her
escort,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ride right and left! Plunder and burn! Do
what damage you may to this hated country from
which Heaven has delivered me!"</p>

<p>Then, as they rode away on their mission of ruin,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to which they had obtained permission from Clovis,
she cried aloud,&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p25" id="p25"></a>
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="THE VOW OF CLOVIS." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">THE VOW OF CLOVIS.</span>
</div>

<p>"I thank thee, God omnipotent, for that I see in
this the beginning of the vengeance which I owe to
my slaughtered parents and brethren!"</p>

<p>In no long time afterwards she joined Clovis,
who received her with a lover's joy, and in due
season the marriage was celebrated, with all the
pomp and ceremony of which those rude times were
capable.</p>

<p>Thus ends the romantic story told us by the
chronicler Fr&eacute;d&eacute;gaire, somewhat too romantic to be
accepted for veracious history, we fear. Yet it is
interesting as a picture of the times, and has doubtless
in it an element of fact&mdash;though it may have
been colored by imagination. Aurelian and Aridius
are historical personages, and what we know of them
is in keeping with what is here told of them. So
the reader may, if he will, accept the story as an
interesting compound of reality and romance.</p>

<p>But there is more to tell. Clotilde had an important
historical part to play, which is picturesquely
described by the chronicler, Gregory of Tours. She
was a Christian, Clovis a pagan; it was natural that
she should desire to convert her husband, and
through him turn the nation of the Franks into
worshippers of Christ. She had a son, whom she
wished to have baptized. She begged her husband
to yield to her wishes.</p>

<p>"The gods you worship," she said, "are of wood,
stone, or metal. They are nought, and can do
nought for you or themselves."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
</p>
<p>"It is by command of our gods that all things
are created," answered Clovis. "It is plain that
your God has no power. There is no proof that he
is even of the race of gods."</p>

<p>Yet he yielded to her wishes and let the child
be baptized. Soon afterwards the infant died, and
Clovis reproached her bitterly.</p>

<p>"Had he been dedicated to my gods he would
still be alive," he said. "He was baptized in the
name of your God, and you see the end; he could
not live."</p>

<p>A second son was born, and was also baptized.
He, too, fell sick.</p>

<p>"It will be with him as with his brother," said
Clovis. "You have had your will in baptizing him,
and he is going to die. Is this the power of your
Christ?"</p>

<p>But the child lived, and Clovis grew less incredulous
of the God of his wife. In the year 496 war
broke out between him and a German tribe. The
Germans were successful, the Franks wavering,
Clovis was anxious. Before hurrying to the front
he had promised his wife&mdash;so says Fr&eacute;d&eacute;gaire&mdash;to
become a Christian if the victory were his. Others
say that he made this promise at the suggestion of
Aurelian, at a moment when the battle seemed lost.
However that be, the tide of battle turned, the victory
remained with the Franks, the Germans were
defeated and their king slain.</p>

<p>Clotilde, fearing that he would forget his promise,
sent secretly to St. Remy, bishop of Rheims, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
come and use his influence with the king. He did
so, and fervently besought Clovis to accept the Christian
faith.</p>

<p>"I would willingly listen to you, holy father,"
said Clovis, "but I fear that the people who follow
me will not give up their gods. I am about to
assemble them, and will repeat to them your words."</p>

<p>He found them more ready than he deemed. The
story of his promise and the victory that followed
it had, doubtless, strongly influenced them. Before
he could speak, most of those present cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We abjure the mortal gods; we are ready to
follow the immortal God whom Remy preaches."</p>

<p>About three thousand of the Franks, however,
refused to give up their old faith, and deserted
Clovis, joining the Frankish King of Cambrai&mdash;who
was before long to pay dearly for this addition
to his ranks.</p>

<p>Christmas-day, 496, was fixed by Remy for the
ceremony of baptism of the king and his followers,
and on that day, with impressive ceremonies, Clovis
the king and about three thousand of his warriors
were made Christians, and the maker of the French
nation was received into the fold of the Church.
From that time forward Clovis won victory after
victory over his surrounding enemies. He had been
born leader of a tribe. He died king of a nation.</p>

<p>As regards Gundebaud, the result proved as Aridius
predicted, whether or not through the personal
influence of Clotilde upon her husband. Clovis
broke his truce with Gondebaud, and entered Burgundy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
with an army. Gondebaud was met and defeated
at Dijon, partly through the treachery of his
brother, whom Clovis had won over. He fled to
Avignon and shut himself up in that stronghold.
Clovis pursued and besieged him. Gondebaud,
filled with alarm, asked counsel of Aridius, who
told him that he had brought this upon himself.</p>

<p>"I will save you, though," he said. "I will
feign to fly and go over to Clovis. Trust me to
act so that he shall ruin neither you nor your land.
But you must do what I ask."</p>

<p>"I will do whatever you bid," said Gondebaud.</p>

<p>Aridius thereupon sought Clovis, in the guise of
a deserter from Gondebaud. But such was his intelligence,
the charm of his conversation, the wisdom
and good judgment of his counsel, that Clovis was
greatly taken with him, and yielded to his advice.</p>

<p>"You gain nothing by ravaging the fields, cutting
down the vines, and destroying the harvests of
your adversary," he said, "while he defies you in his
stronghold. Rather send him deputies, and lay on
him a tribute to be paid you every year. Thus the
land will be preserved, and you be lord forever over
him who owes you tribute. If he refuse, then do
what pleases you."</p>

<p>Clovis deemed the advice good, did as requested,
and found Gondebaud more than willing to become
his tributary vassal. And thus ended the contest
between them, Burgundy becoming a tributary
province of France.

<a name="h2-3" id="h2-3"></a><h2><i>THE RIVAL QUEENS.</i></h2>

<p>From the days of Clovis to the days of Charles
Martel and Charlemagne the history of the Frankish
realm, so far as its kingship is concerned, is
almost a blank. It was an era of several centuries
of incompetent and sluggish monarchs, of whom
we can say little more than that they were born
and died; they can scarcely be said to have reigned.
But from the midst of this dull interregnum of
Merovingian sluggards comes to us the story of two
queens, women of force and power, whose biography
is full of the elements of romance. As a picture
of the manners and customs of the Merovingian
epoch we cannot do better than to tell the stories
of these queens, Fredegonde and Brunehild by name,
whose rivalry and enmity, with their consequences,
throw a striking light on the history of those
obscure times.</p>

<p>What is now France was at that time divided into
three kingdoms, Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy,
King Chilperic reigning over Austrasia; King Sigebert
over Neustria. But the power behind the
throne lay in the wives of these kings, with whom
alone we have to do. Contrasted characters they
were,&mdash;Fredegonde wicked, faithless, self-seeking;
Brunehild patriotic and devoted to the good of her
country; yet in the end wickedness triumphed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
honesty died a violent and frightful death. With
this preliminary we may proceed with our tale.
</p>
<p>Fredegonde was the daughter of poor peasants,
who dwelt in the vicinity of Montdidier in Picardy.
But so striking and notable was her beauty that at
an early age she was made, under circumstances of
which we are not informed, one of the ladies in
waiting on Queen Andovere, the first wife of King
Chilperic. The poor queen was destined to suffer
from the artfulness of her maid. The beauty of
Fredegonde quickly attracted the attention of the
king, and her skilful and unscrupulous arts soon
made her a power in the court. The queen was in
her way; but no long time passed before, on the
pretext of a spiritual relationship with her husband
which rendered the marriage illegal, the hapless
Andovere was repudiated and banished to a convent.</p>

<p>But Chilperic was not yet ready to marry a peasant.
He chose for his second wife Galsuinthe,
daughter of the king of the Visigoths. This marriage
lasted a still shorter time than the other.
Galsuinthe was found strangled in her bed; and
now, no longer able to restrain his passion for the
beautiful and artful maid of honor, Chilperic married
Fredegonde, and raised the peasant maiden
to the throne for which she had so deeply and
darkly wrought.</p>

<p>The marriage of Galsuinthe had been preceded
by that of her younger sister, Brunehild, who became
the wife of Sigebert, brother of Chilperic and
king of Austrasia. The murder of Galsuinthe was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
ascribed by Brunehild to Fredegonde, with excellent
reason if we may judge from her subsequent career,
and from that day on an undying hatred existed
between the two queens. To this the stirring incidents
of their after lives were due. War broke
out between the two kings, probably inspired by
Brunehild's thirst for revenge for her sister's death
on the one hand, and the ambition and hatred of
Fredegonde on the other. Sigebert was successful
in the field, but treachery soon robbed him of the
fruits of victory. He was murdered in his tent (in
the year 575) by two assassins in the pay of Queen
Fredegonde.</p>

<p>This murder gave Chilperic the ascendancy.
Sigebert's army disbanded, and Brunehild, as the
only means of preserving her life, sought an asylum
in the cathedral of Paris. And now the scene becomes
one of rapid changes, in which the unscrupulous
Fredegonde plays the leading part. Chilperic,
not daring to offend the church by slaying the fugitive
queen under its protection, sent her to Rouen.
Here the widowed lady, her beauty rendered more
attractive by her misfortunes, was seen and loved
by Merov&eacute;e, the son of Chilperic by his first wife,
then in that town on a mission from his father.
Fired with passion for the hapless queen, he married
her privately, the Bishop of Rouen sealing their
union.</p>

<p>This imprudent action soon became known at
the court of Chilperic, and the ambitious Fredegonde
hastened to turn it to her advantage. Merov&eacute;e
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
was heir to the throne of Chilperic. He was in
her way, and had now given her a pretext for his
removal. Chilperic, who seems to have been the
weak slave of her designs, would have seized both
Merov&eacute;e and his bride but for the Austrasians, who
demanded that their queen Brunehild should be
restored to them, and enforced their demands with
threats. She was surrendered; but Merov&eacute;e, under
the influence of his step-mother, was imprisoned,
then shorn and shut up in a monastery, and afterwards
became a fugitive, and was urged to head
a rebellion against his father. Such was the terror,
however, which the unhappy youth entertained
for his cruel step-mother, that he put an end to
his existence by suicide, inducing a faithful servant
to strike him dead.</p>

<p>Fredegonde's success in getting rid of one of
the heirs to the throne, only partly satisfied her
ambitious views. There was another son, Clovis,
brother of Merov&eacute;e. To rid herself of him the wily
queen took another course. Three of her own children
had recently died, and she ascribed their death
to Clovis, whom she accused of sorcery. He was
seized under this charge, thrown into prison, and
there ended his career, a poniard-thrust closing his
brief tale of life. The tale of murders in this direction
was completed by that of the repudiated Queen
Andovere, who was soon found strangled in the convent
to which she had been consigned.</p>

<p>Fredegonde had thus rid herself of all claimants
to the throne outside of herself and her descendants,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Galsuinthe having left no children. Though
death had recently robbed her of three children, one
survived, a son named Clotaire, then a few months
old. Her next act of treachery was to make away
with her weak and confiding husband, perhaps that
she might reign alone, perhaps through fear that
Chilperic might discover her guilty relations with
Landry, an officer of the court, and subsequently
mayor of the palace. Whatever the reason, soon
after these events, King Chilperic, while in the act
of dismounting on his return from the chase, was
struck two mortal blows by a man who took to
rapid flight, while all around the cry was raised,
"Treason! it is the hand of the Austrasian Childebert
against our lord the king!"</p>

<p>The readiness with which this cry was raised
seemed evidence of its falsity. Men ascribed it and
the murder to emissaries of Fredegonde. But,
heedless of their opinions, she installed herself as
sovereign guardian of her infant son, and virtual
reigning queen of Neustria. It was now the year
584. Fredegonde had by her beauty, ambition, boldness,
and unscrupulousness raised herself from the
lowly rank of a peasant's daughter to the high position
of sovereign over a great dominion, a queenship
which she was to hold during the remainder
of her life, her strong will, effrontery, artifice, skill
in deception, and readiness to strengthen her position
by crime, enabling her to overcome all resistance
and maintain her ascendancy over the restless
and barbarous elements of the kingdom she ruled.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
She was a true product of the times, one born to
become dominant over a barbarous people.</p>

<p>Gregory of Tours tells a story of Chilperic and
Fredegonde, which will bear repetition here. In
addition to the sons of Chilperic, of whom the queen
disposed as we have seen, he had a daughter,
Rigouthe by name, whom he promised in marriage
to Prince Recared, son of the king of the Visigoths
of Spain.</p>

<p>"A grand deputation of Goths came to Paris to
fetch the Frankish princess. King Chilperic
ordered several families in the fiscal domains to
be seized and placed in cars. As a great number
of them wept and were not willing to go, he had
them kept in prison that he might more easily force
them to go away with his daughter. It is said that
several, in their despair, hung themselves, fearing
to be taken from their parents. Sons were separated
from fathers, daughters from mothers, and all
departed with deep groans and maledictions, and
in Paris there reigned a desolation like that of
Egypt. Not a few, of superior birth, being forced
to go away, even made wills whereby they left their
possessions to the churches, and demanded that, so
soon as the young girl should have entered Spain,
their wills should be opened just as if they were
already in their graves.</p>

<p>"When King Chilperic gave up his daughter to
the ambassadors of the Goths, he presented them
with vast treasures. Queen Fredegonde added
thereto so great a quantity of gold and silver and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
valuable vestments that, at the sight thereof, the
king thought he must have nought remaining. The
queen, perceiving his emotion, turned to the Franks,
and said to them,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Think not, warriors, that there is here aught
of the treasures of former kings. All that ye see is
taken from my own possessions, for my most glorious
king has made me many gifts. Thereto have I
added of the fruits of my own toil, and a great part
proceeds from the revenues I have drawn, either in
kind or in money, from the houses that have been
ceded unto me. Ye yourselves have given me riches,
and ye see here a portion thereof; but there is here
nought of the public treasure.'</p>

<p>"And the king was deceived into believing her
words. Such was the multitude of golden and silver
articles and other precious things that it took fifty
wagons to hold them. The Franks, on their part,
made many offerings; some gave gold, others silver,
sundry gave horses, but most of them vestments.</p>

<p>"At last the young girl, with many tears and
kisses, said farewell. As she was passing through
the gate an axle of her carriage broke, and all cried
out 'Alack!' which was interpreted by some as a
presage. She departed from Paris, and at eight
miles' distance from the city she had her tents
pitched. During the night fifty men arose and,
having taken a hundred of the best horses, and as
many golden bits and bridles, and two large silver
dishes, fled away, and took refuge with King Childebert.
During the whole journey whoever could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
escape fled away with all that he could lay hands
on. It was required also of all the towns that were
traversed on the way that they should make great
preparations to defray expenses, for the king forbade
any contribution from the treasury. All the
charges were met by extraordinary taxes levied upon
the poor."</p>

<p>In this story there is probably much exaggeration,
but it has its significance as a picture of life in the
dark ages, from one to the manner born. So far as
Fredegonde was concerned, the marriage of
Rigouthe removed from her path one possible future
rival for the throne.</p>

<p>Twice in the foregoing pages Childebert of Austrasia
has been mentioned. Who was this Childebert,
it may be asked? He was the son of
Brunehild, whom the Austrasians had preserved
after the murder of their king, and as a guardian
for whom they had insisted on the return, by Chilperic,
of the captive queen. Brunehild from that
time reigned in Austrasia during the minority of
her son, and in a manner in striking contrast with
the reign of her wicked rival.</p>

<p>Unlike the latter, she was a princess by birth, and
of that race of Gothic kings who had preserved
some traces of the Roman civilization. Fredegonde
was a barbarian, Brunehild a scion of a semi-civilization
and far superior to her rival in culture
and intellectual power. As a queen she did so much
for her country that her name as a public benefactor
was long afterwards remembered in the land. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
highways, the bridges, all the public works of the
state received her careful attention, so much so that
the Roman roads in Austrasia received, and long
retained, the name of "Brunehild's Causeways."
Her name was associated with many other things
in the land. In a forest near Bourges men long
pointed out "Brunehild's castle," at Etampes was
shown "Brunehild's tower," and near Cahors
"Brunehild's fort." A more interesting evidence
of her activity for the good of her people for ages
existed in the by-word of "Brunehild's alms,"
which long retained the evidence of her abundant
charities. She protected men of letters,&mdash;a rare
production in that day,&mdash;and in return we find one
of them, Fortunatus, bishop of Poitiers, dedicating
poems to her.</p>

<p>But the life of Queen Brunehild was far from
being a quiet one. In addition to her conflicts with
her mortal foe, Queen Fredegonde, she had her own
nobles to fight against. They seem to have detested
her from the fact that her palace was filled with
royal officers and favorites, whose presence excited
the jealousy of the great landholders and warriors.
But Brunehild protected them, with unyielding
courage, against their foes, and proved herself every
inch a queen. It was a semblance of the Roman
imperial monarchy which she wished to establish
in Austrasia, and to her efforts in this direction
were due her struggles with the turbulent lords
of the land, whose opposition gave her more and
more trouble as time went on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
</p>
<p>A story of this conflict is told by Gregory of
Tours. One of the palace officers of the queen,
Lupus, a Roman by birth, but made by her duke
of Champagne, "was being constantly insulted and
plundered by his enemies, especially by Ursion Bertfried.
At last, having agreed to slay him, they
marched against him with an army. At the sight,
Brunehild, compassionating the evil case of one of
her lieges unjustly presented, assumed a manly
courage, and threw herself among the hostile battalions,
crying, 'Stay, warriors; refrain from this
wicked deed; persecute not the innocent; engage
not, for a single man's sake, in a battle which will
desolate the country!' 'Back, woman!' said
Ursion to her; 'let it suffice thee to have ruled
under thy husband's sway. Now it is thy son that
reigns, and his kingdom is under our protection, not
thine. Back! if thou wouldst not that the hoofs
of our horses trample thee under as the dust of the
ground!' After the dispute had lasted some time
in this strain, the queen, by her address, at last
prevented the battle from taking place."</p>

<p>The words of Ursion were prophetic. To be
trampled under horses' hoofs into the dust was the
final fate of the queen, though for many years yet
she was to retain her power and to keep up her
strife with the foes who surrounded her. Far
nobler of soul than Fredegonde, she was as strong
in all those qualities which go to make a vigorous
queen.</p>

<p>But we must hasten on to the end of these royal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
rivals. Fredegonde died quietly in Paris, in 597,
powerful to her death, and leaving on the throne
her son Clotaire II., whom she had infected with all
her hatred against the queen of Austrasia. Brunehild
lived till 614, thirty-nine years after the death
of her husband Sigebert, and through the reigns
of her son and two of her grandsons, who were but
puppets in her hands. Her later years were marked
by lack of womanly virtue, and by an unscrupulousness
in ridding herself of her enemies significant of
barbarous times. At length, when she had reached
the advanced age of eighty years, she was deserted
by her army and her people whom the crimes imputed
to her had incensed, and fell into the hands
of her mortal foe, Clotaire II., in whom all the
venom of his cruel mother seemed retained.</p>

<p>After having subjected the aged queen to base
and gross insults and severe tortures, the crowned
wretch had her paraded on a camel in front of his
whole army, and then tied by one arm, one foot,
and hair of her head to the tail of an unbroken
horse, which dashed and kicked her to pieces as he
rushed away in affright, before the eyes of the
ferocious Clotaire and his army.</p>

<p>By the death of Brunehild and her sons, whom
Clotaire also put to death, this king became master
of Austrasia, and thus lord of all the Frankish
realm, the successor in power of the two queens
whose story stands out so prominently in that dark
and barbarous age.

<a name="h2-4" id="h2-4"></a><h2><i>ROLAND AT RONCESVALLES.</i></h2>

<p>From the long, straight ridge of the Pyrenees,
stretching from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean,
and dividing the land of France from that
of Spain, there extend numerous side-hills, like buttresses
to the main mountain mass, running far
into the plains on either side. Between these
rugged buttresses lie narrow valleys, now spreading
into broad amphitheatres, now contracting into
straightened ravines, winding upward to the passes
across the mountain chain. Dense forests often
border these valleys, covering the mountain-sides
and summits, and hiding with their deep-green
foliage the rugged rocks from which they spring.
Such is the scene of the celebrated story which we
have next to tell.</p>

<p>All these mountain valleys are filled with legends,
centring around a great event and a mighty hero
of the remote past, whose hand and sword made
famous the little vale of Roncesvalles, which lies
between the defiles of Sizer and Val Carlos, in the
land of the Basques. This hero was Roland, the
nephew of the great emperor Charlemagne, who has
been given by romantic fiction the first place among
the legendary Paladins of France, and made memorable
in epic poetry as the hero of the celebrated
"Orlando Furioso" of Ariosto, and the less notable
"Orlando Innamorato" of Boiardo.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>All these stories are based upon a very slender
fabric of history, which would have been long since
forgotten had not legend clung to it with so loving
a hand, and credited its hero with such a multitude
of marvellous deeds. The history of the event is
preserved for us by Eginhard, the secretary and
annalist of Charlemagne. He takes few words to
tell what has given rise to innumerable strophes.</p>

<p>In the year 778, Charlemagne invaded Spain,
then almost wholly in the hands of the Saracens.
His march was a victorious one until Saragossa was
reached. Here he found himself before a well-supplied,
strongly-fortified, and fully-garrisoned
city, while his own army was none too well provided
with food. In the end he found it expedient to
retreat, leaving Saragossa still in Saracen hands.</p>

<p>The retreat was conducted without loss until the
Pyrenees were reached. These were crossed by the
main body of the army without hostile disturbance,
leaving to follow the baggage-train and a rear-guard
under the king's nephew Roland, prefect of the
Marches of Brittany, with whom were Eginhard,
master of the household, and Anselm, count of the
palace; while legend adds the names of Oliver,
Roland's bosom friend, the warlike Archbishop
Turpin, and other warriors of renown.</p>

<p>Their route lay through the pass of Roncesvalles
so narrow at points that only two, or at most three
men could move abreast, while the rugged bordering
hills were covered with dense forest, affording a
secure retreat for an ambushing foe. It was when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the main body of the army was miles in advance,
and the rear-guard struggling up this narrow defile,
that disaster came. Suddenly the surrounding
woods and mountains bristled with life. A host of
light-armed Basque mountaineers emerged from
the forest, and poured darts and arrows upon the
crowded columns of heavily-armed Franks below.
Rocks were rolled down the steep declivities, crushing
living men beneath their weight. The surprised
troops withdrew in haste to the bottom of the
valley, death pursuing them at every step. The
battle that followed was doubtless a severe and hotly-contested
one; the prominent place it has gained
in tradition indicates that the Franks must have
defended themselves valiantly; but they fought
at a terrible disadvantage, and in the end they were
killed to a man. Then the assailants, rich with
the plunder which they had obtained from the
baggage-wagons and the slain bodies, vanished into
the forests whence they came, leaving to Charlemagne,
when he returned in search of Roland and
his men, only the silence of death and the livid
heaps of the slain in that terrible valley of slaughter.</p>

<p>Such is the sober fact. Fancy has adorned it
with a thousand loving fictions. In the valleys are
told a multitude of tales connected with Roland's
name. A part of his armor has given its name to
a flower of the hills, the <i>casque de Roland</i>, a species
of hellebore. The <i>breiche de Roland</i>, a deep fissure
in the mountain crest, is ascribed to a stroke of his
mighty blade. The sound of his magic horn still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
seems to echo around those rugged crests and pulse
through those winding valleys, as it did on the day
when, as legend says, it was borne to the ears of
Charlemagne miles away, and warned him of the
deadly peril of his favorite chieftain.</p>

<p>This horn is reputed to have had magical powers.
Its sound was so intense as to split all other horns.
The story goes that Roland, himself sadly wounded,
his fellows falling thickly around him, blew upon
it so mighty a blast that the veins and nerves of his
neck burst under the effort. The sound reached
the ears of Charlemagne, then encamped eight miles
away, in the Val Carlos pass.</p>

<p>"It is Roland's horn," he cried. "He never
blows it except the extremity be great. We must
hasten to his aid."</p>

<p>"I have known him to sound it on light occasions,"
answered Ganalon, Roland's secret foe. "He
is, perhaps, pursuing some wild beast, and the sound
echoes through the wood. It would be fruitless to
lead back your weary host to seek him."</p>

<p>Charlemagne yielded to his specious argument,
and Roland and all his followers died. Charles
afterwards discovered the body with the arms extended
in the form of a cross, and wept over it his
bitterest tears. "There did Charlemagne," says
the legend, "mourn for Orlando to the very last
day of his life. On the spot where he died he encamped
and caused the body to be embalmed with
balsam, myrrh, and aloes. The whole camp watched
it that night, honoring his corpse with hymns and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
songs, and innumerable torches and fires kindled in
the adjacent mountains."</p>

<p>At the battle of Hastings the minstrel Taillefer,
as we have elsewhere told, rode before the advancing
Norman host, singing the "Song of Roland," till
a British hand stilled his song and laid him low
in death. This ancient song is attributed, though
doubtfully, to Turold, that abbot of Peterborough
who was so detested by Hereward the Wake. From
it came many of the stories which afterwards were
embodied in the epic legends of medi&aelig;val days.
To quote a few passages from it may not be amiss.
The poet tells us that Roland refused to blow his
magic horn in the beginning of the battle. In the
end, when ruin and death were gathering fast
around, and blood was flowing freely from his own
veins, he set his lips to the mighty instrument, and
filled vales and mountains with its sound.</p>

<a name="h2-5" id="h2-5"></a><h2><i>CHARLEMAGNE AND THE
AVARS.</i></h2>

<p>Striking is the story which the early centuries
of modern Europe have to tell us. After the era of
the busy building of empire in which the sturdy old
Romans were the active agents, there came an era
of the overthrow of empire, during which the vast
results of centuries of active civilization seemed
about to sink and be lost in the seething whirlpool
of barbarism. The wild hordes of the north of
Europe overflowed the rich cities and smiling plains
of the south, and left ruin where they found wealth
and splendor. Later, the half-savage nomades of
eastern Europe and northern Asia&mdash;the devastating
Huns&mdash;poured out upon the budding kingdoms
which had succeeded the mighty empire of Rome,
and threatened to trample under foot all that was
left of the work of long preceding ages. Civilization
had swung downward into barbarism; was barbarism
to swing downward into savagery, and man
return to his primitive state?</p>

<p>Against such a conceivable fate of Europe Charlemagne
served as a mighty bulwark, and built by his
genius an impermeable wall against the torrent of
savage invasion, saying to its inflowing waves,
"Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther."
Attila, the "Scourge of God," in the track of whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
horses' hoofs "no grass could grow," met his only
great defeat at Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne, on the soil of
Gaul. He died in Hungary; his hordes were scattered;
Europe again began to breathe. But not
long had the Huns of Attila ceased their devastations
when another tribe of Hunnish origin appeared,
and began a like career of ravage and ruin.
These called themselves Avars. Small in numbers
at first, they grew by vanquishing and amalgamating
other tribes of Huns until they became the
terror and threatened to become the masters of
Europe. Hungary, the centre of Attila's great
circle of power, was made their place of abode.
Here was the palace and stronghold of their monarchs,
the Chagans, and here they continued a threat
to all the surrounding nations, while enjoying the
vast spoils which they had wrung from ruined
peoples.</p>

<p>Time passed on; civilization showed feeble signs
of recovery; France and Italy became its abiding-places;
but barbarian invasion still threatened these
lands, and no security could be felt while the hordes
of the north and east remained free to move at will.
This was the task that Charlemagne was born to
perform. Before his day the Huns of the east, the
Saxons of the north, the Moors of the south kept
the growing civilization of France in constant alarm.
After his day aggression by land was at an end;
only by sea could the north invade the south.</p>

<p>The record of the deeds of Charlemagne is a long
one. The Saxons were conquered and incorporated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
into the kingdom of the Franks. Then collision
with the Avars took place. The story of how
Charlemagne dealt with these savage hordes is one
of the most interesting episodes in the extended
tale of his wars, and we therefore select it for our
present theme. The Avars had long been quiet, but
now again began to stir, making two invasions,
one of Lombardy, the other of Bavaria. Both were
repelled. Stung by defeat, they raised a greater
army than before, and in 788 crossed the Danube,
determined in their savage souls to teach these
proud Franks a lesson, and write on their land in
blood the old story of the prowess and invincibility
of the Huns. To their alarm and astonishment
they found themselves not only checked, but utterly
routed, thousands of them being left dead upon the
field, and other thousands swallowed up by the
Danube, in their wild effort to swim that swollen
stream.</p>

<p>This brings us to the record of the dealings of
Charlemagne with the Huns, who had thus dared to
invade his far-extending kingdom. Vast had been
the work of this mighty monarch in subduing the
unquiet realms around him. Italy had been made a
part of his dominions, Spain invaded and quieted,
and the Saxons, the fiercest people of the north,
forced to submit to the power of the Franks. Now
the Avars of Hungary, the most dangerous of the
remaining neighbors of Charlemagne's great empire,
were to be dealt with.</p>

<p>During the two years succeeding their defeat,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
overtures for peace passed between the Avars and
Charlemagne, overtures which, perhaps, had their
chief purpose in the desire to gain time to prepare
for war.</p>

<p>These nomadic hordes were celebrated alike for
their cunning and their arrogance,&mdash;cunning when
they had an object to gain, arrogance when they had
gained it. In their dealings with Charlemagne
they displayed the same mixture of artfulness and
insolence which they had employed in their dealings
with the empire of the East. But they had now to
do with a different man from the weak emperors
of Constantinople. Charlemagne continued his
negotiations, but prepared for hostilities, and in
the spring of 791 put himself at the head of a powerful
army, prepared to repay the barbarian hordes
with some of the havoc which they had dealt out to
the other nations of Europe.</p>

<p>It was no light task he had undertaken, and the
great general made ready for it with the utmost care
and deliberation. He was about to invade a country
of great resources, of remarkable natural and
artificial defences, and inhabited by a people celebrated
for their fierceness and impetuosity, and who
had hitherto known little besides victory. And he
was to leave behind him in his march a kingdom
full of unquiet elements, which needed the presence
of his strong arm and quick mind to keep it in
subjection. He knew not but that the Saxons might
rise upon his march and spread ruin upon his path.
There was one way to avoid this, and that he took.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Years before, he had incorporated the Lombards
with his army, and found them to fight as valiantly
for him as against him. He now did the same
with the Saxons, drafting a large body of them
into his ranks, with the double purpose of weakening
the fighting power of the nation, and employing
their fierce courage in his own service. All winter
the world of the Franks was in commotion, preparing
for war. The chroniclers of the times speak
of "innumerable multitudes" which the great conqueror
set in motion in the early spring.</p>

<p>The army marched in three grand divisions. One
entered Bavaria, joined to itself recruits raised in
that country, and descended the Danube in boats,
which carried also an abundance of provisions and
military stores. A second division, under Charlemagne
himself, marched along the southern side of
the river; and a third, under his generals Theoderic
and Meginfried, along its northern banks. The
emperor had besides sent orders to his son Pepin,
king of Italy, bidding him to lead an army of Lombards
and other Italians to the frontier of Hungary,
and co-operate with the other troops.</p>

<p>Before telling the story of the expedition, it behooves
us to give some account of the country which
the king of the Franks was about to invade, and
particularly to describe the extraordinary defences
and interior conditions with which it is credited by
the gossipy old Monk of St. Gall, the most entertaining,
though hardly the most credible, writer
of that period. All authors admit that the country
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the Avars was defended by an ingenious and
singular system of fortifications. The account we
propose to give, the Monk of St. Gall declares that
he wrote down from the words of an eye-witness,
Adelbart by name, who took part in the expedition.
But one cannot help thinking that either this eye-witness
mingled a strong infusion of imagination
with his vision, or that the monk added fiction to
his facts, with the laudable purpose of making an
attractive story. Such as it is, we give it, without
further comment.</p>

<p>Nine concentric circles of palisaded walls, says
the garrulous old monk, surrounded the country
of the Avars, the outer one enclosing the entire realm
of Hungary, the inner ones growing successively
smaller, the innermost being the central fortification
within which dwelt the Chagan, with his palace
and his treasures. These walls were made of double
rows of palisades of oak, beech, and pine logs,
twenty feet high and twenty feet asunder, the interval
between them being filled with stone and lime.
Thus was formed a great wall, which at a distance
must have presented a singular appearance, since
the top was covered with soil and planted with
bushes and trees.</p>

<p>The outermost wall surrounded the whole country.
Within it, at a distance of twenty Teutonic, or
forty Italian, miles, was a second, of smaller diameter,
but constructed in the same manner. At an
equal distance inward was a third, and thus they
continued inward, fortress after fortress, to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
number of nine, the outer one rivalling the Chinese
wall in extent, the inner one&mdash;the <i>ring</i>, as it was
called&mdash;being of small diameter, and enclosing a
central space within which the Avars guarded the
accumulated wealth of centuries of conquest and
plunder.</p>

<p>The only places of exit from these great palisaded
fortifications were very narrow gates, or sally-ports,
opening at proper intervals, and well guarded by
armed sentinels. The space between the successive
ramparts was a well-wooded and thickly-settled
country, filled with villages and homesteads, so
close together that the sound of a trumpet could
be heard from one to the other, and thus an alarm
from the exterior be conveyed with remarkable
rapidity throughout the whole land.</p>

<p>This and more the veracious Monk of St. Gall
tells us. As to believing him, that is quite another
matter. Sufficient is told by other writers to convince
us that the country was guarded by strong and
singular defences, but the nine concentric circles of
breastworks, surpassing the Chinese wall in length
and size, the reader is quite privileged to doubt.</p>

<p>Certainly the defences failed to check the advance
of the army of Charlemagne. Though he had begun
his march in the spring, so extensive were his
preparations that it was September before he reached
the banks of the river Enns, the border line between
Bavaria and Hungary. Here the army encamped
for three days, engaged in prayers for victory, and
here encouraging news came to Charlemagne. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
son Pepin, with the Duke of Friuli, had already
invaded Hungary, met an army of the Avars, and
defeated it with great slaughter. The news of this
success must have invigorated the army under
Charlemagne. Breaking camp, they invaded the
country of the Avars, advancing with the usual
impetuosity of their great leader. One after another
the Hungarian lines of defence were taken,
until three had fallen, while the country between
them was laid waste. No army appeared in the
path of the invaders; sword in hand, Charlemagne
assailed and broke through the strong walls of his
foes; soon he reached the river Raab, which he followed
to its junction with the Danube.</p>

<p>Until now all had promised complete success.
Those frightful Huns, who had so long kept Europe
in terror, seemed about to be subdued and made
subjects of the great monarch of the Franks. But,
through that fatality which so often ruins the best-laid
plans of men, Charlemagne suddenly found
himself in a perilous and critical situation. His
army was composed almost wholly of cavalry. As
he lay encamped by the Danube, a deadly pestilence
attacked the horses, and swept them off with such
rapidity that a hasty retreat became necessary.
Nine-tenths of the horses had perished before the
retiring army reached Bavaria. Good fortune,
however, attended the retreat. Had the Avars recovered
from the panic into which their successive
defeats had thrown them, they might have taken a
disastrous revenge upon the invaders. But as it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was, Charlemagne succeeded in retiring without
being attacked, and was able to take with him the
valuable booty and the host of prisoners which were
the trophies of his victorious progress.</p>

<p>He fully intended to return and complete the conquest
of Hungary in the spring, and, to facilitate
his advance, had a bridge of boats constructed,
during the winter, across the Danube. He never
returned, as it happened. Circumstances hindered.
But in 794 his subject, the margrave Eric, Duke of
Friuli, again invaded Hungary, which had in the
interval been exhausted by civil wars. All the defences
of the Avars went down before him, and his
victorious troops penetrated to that inner fortress,
called the <i>Ring</i>, which so long had been the boasted
stronghold of the Chagans, and within whose confines
were gathered the vast treasures which the conquering
hordes had accumulated during centuries
of victory and plunder, together with the great
wealth in gold and silver coin which they had wrung
by way of tribute from the weak rulers of the Eastern
Empire. A conception of the extent of this
spoil may be gathered from the fact that the Greek
emperor during the seventh century paid the Avars
annually as tribute eighty thousand gold solidi,
and that on a single occasion the Emperor Heraclius
was forced to pay them an equal sum.</p>

<p>In a nation that had made any progress towards
civilization this wealth would have been distributed
and perhaps dissipated. But the only use which
the half-savage Avars seem to have found for it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
was to store it up as spoil. For centuries it had
been accumulating within the treasure-house of the
<i>Ring</i>, in convenient form to be seized and borne
away by the conquering army which now broke into
this long-defiant stronghold. The great bulk of
this wealth, consisting of gold and silver coin, vessels
of the precious metals, garments of great value,
rich weapons and ornaments, jewels of priceless
worth, and innumerable other articles, was taken
to Aix-la-Chapelle, and laid at the feet of Charlemagne,
to be disposed of as he saw fit. So extensive
was it, that, as we are told, fifteen wagons, each
drawn by four oxen, were needed to convey it to the
capital of the mighty emperor.</p>

<p>Charlemagne dealt with it in a very different
manner from that pursued by the monarchs of the
Avars. He distributed it with a liberal hand, the
church receiving valuable donations, including some
of the most splendid objects, a large share being set
aside for the pope, and most of the balance being
given to the poor and to the royal officers, nobles,
and soldiers. The amount thus divided was so great
that, as we are told, the nation of the Franks "became
rich, whereas they had been poor before."
That treasure which the barbarian invaders had
been centuries in collecting from the nations of
Europe was in a few months again scattered far and
wide.</p>

<p>Eric's invasion was followed by one from Pepin,
king of Italy, who in his turn entered the <i>Ring</i>,
took the wealth which Eric's raiders had left, demolished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the palace of the Chagan, and completely
destroyed the central stronghold of the Avars. They
were not, however, fully subdued. Risings afterwards
took place, invading armies were destroyed,
and not until 803 was a permanent conquest made.
The Avars in the end accepted baptism and held
themselves as vassals or subjects of the great Frankish
monarch, who permitted them to retain some
of their old laws and governmental forms. At a
subsequent date they were nearly exterminated by
the Moravians, and after the year 827 this once
powerful people disappear from history. Part of
their realm was incorporated with Moravia, and
remained so until the incursion of the Magyars in
884.</p>

<p>As regards the location of the <i>Ring</i>, or central
stronghold of the Avars, it is believed to have been
in the wide plain between the Danube and the
Theiss, the probable site being the Pusste-Sarto-Sar,
on the right of the Tatar. Traces of the
wonderful circular wall, or of the palisaded and
earth-filled fortifications of the Avars, are said still
to exist in this locality. They are known as Avarian
Rings, and in a measure sustain the old stories
told of them, though hardly that of the legend-loving
Monk of St. Gall and his romancing informant.

<a name="h2-6" id="h2-6"></a><h2><i>THE CROWNING OF
CHARLEMAGNE.</i></h2>

<p>Charlemagne, the great king, had built himself
an empire only surpassed by that of ancient Rome.
All France was his; all Italy was his; all Saxony
and Hungary were his; all western Europe indeed,
from the borders of Slavonia to the Atlantic, with
the exception of Spain, was his. He was the
bulwark of civilization against the barbarism of
the north and east, the right hand of the church
in its conflict with paganism, the greatest and
noblest warrior the world had seen since the days
of the great C&aelig;sar, and it seemed fitting that he
should be given the honor which was his due, and
that in him and his kingdom the great empire of
Rome should be restored.</p>

<p>Augustulus, the last emperor of the west, had
ceased to reign in 476. The Eastern Empire was
still alive, or rather half-alive, for it was a life
without spirit or energy. The empire of the west
had vanished under the flood of barbarism, and for
more than three centuries there had been no claimant
of the imperial crown. But here was a strong
man, a noble man, the lord and master of a mighty
realm which included the old imperial city; it
seemed fitting that he should take the title of emperor
and rule over the western world as the successor
of the famous line of the C&aelig;sars.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>So thought the pope, Leo III., and so thought his
cardinals. He had already sent to Charlemagne the
keys of the prison of St. Peter and the banner of
the city of Rome. In 799 he had a private interview
with the king, whose purpose no one knew.
In August of the year 800, having settled the affairs
of his wide-spread kingdom, Charlemagne suddenly
announced in the general assembly of the Franks
that he was about to make a journey to Rome. Why
he went he did not say. The secret was not yet
ready to be revealed.</p>

<p>On the 23d of November the king of the Franks
arrived at the gates of Rome, a city which he was
to leave with the time-honored title of Emperor of
the West. "The pope received him as he was dismounting;
then, on the next day, standing on the
steps of the basilica of St. Peter and amidst general
hallelujahs, he introduced the king into the sanctuary
of the blessed apostle, glorifying and thanking
the Lord for this happy event."</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Charlemagne examined
the grievances of the Church and took measures to
protect the pope against his enemies. And while he
was there two monks came from Jerusalem, bearing
with them the keys of the Holy Sepulchre and
Calvary, and the sacred standard of the holy city,
which the patriarch had intrusted to their care to
present to the great king of the Franks. Charlemagne
was thus virtually commissioned as the
defender of the Church of Christ and the true successor
of the Christian emperors of Rome.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Leo had called a synod of the Church
to consider whether the title of emperor should not
be conferred on Charles the Great. At present, he
said, the Roman world had no sovereign. The
throne of Constantinople was occupied by a woman,
the Empress Irene, who had usurped the title and
made it her own by murder. It was intolerable that
Charles should be looked on as a mere patrician, an
implied subordinate to this unworthy sovereign of
the Eastern Empire. He was the master of Italy,
Gaul, and Germany, said Leo. Who was there besides
him to act as Defender of the Faith? On
whom besides could the Church rest, in its great
conflict with paganism and unbelief?</p>

<p>The synod agreed with him. It was fitting that
the great king should be crowned emperor, and
restore in his person the ancient glory of the realm.
A petition was sent to Charles. He answered that,
however unworthy the honor, he could not resist
the desire of that august body. And thus was formally
completed what probably had been the secret
understanding of the pope and the king months
before. Charles, king of the Franks, was to be
given the title and dignity of Charles, Emperor of
the West.</p>

<p>The season of the Feast of the Nativity,
Christmas-day of the year 800, duly came. It was
destined to be a great day in the annals of the
Roman city. The chimes of bells which announced
the dawning of that holy day fell on the ears of
great multitudes assembled in the streets of Rome,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
all full of the grand event that day to be consummated,
and rumors of which had spread far and
wide. The great basilica of St. Peter was to be
the scene of the imposing ceremony, and at the hour
fixed its aisles were crowded with the greatest and
the most devoted and enthusiastic assemblage it had
ever held, all eager to behold and to lend their support
to the glorious act of coronation, as they
deemed it, fixed for that day, an act which, as they
hoped, would restore Rome to the imperial position
which that great city had so many centuries held.</p>

<p>It was a noble pile, that great cathedral of the
early church. It had been recently enriched by
costly gifts set aside by Charles from the spoils of
the Avars, and converted into the most beautiful of
ornaments consecrated to the worship of Christ.
Before the altar stood the golden censers, containing
seventeen pounds weight of solid gold. Above
gleamed three grand coronas of solid silver, of
three hundred and seven pounds in weight, ablaze
with a glory of wax-lights, whose beams softly
illuminated the whole great edifice. The shrine
of St. Peter dazzled the eyes by its glittering
"rufas," made of forty-nine pounds of the purest
gold, and enriched by brilliant jewels till they
sparkled like single great gems. There also hung
superb curtains of white silk, embroidered with
roses, and with rich and intricate borders, while in
the centre was a splendid cross worked in gold and
purple. Suspended from the keystone of the dome
hung the most attractive of the many fine pictures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
which adorned the church, a peerless painting of the
Saviour, whose beauty drew all eyes and aroused in
all souls fervent aspirations of devoted faith. Never
had Christian church presented a grander spectacle;
never had one held so immense and enthusiastic
an audience; for one of the greatest ceremonies
the Christian world had known was that day to be
performed.</p>

<p>Through the wide doors of the great church filed
a procession of bronzed veterans of the Frankish
army; the nobility and the leading people of Rome;
the nobles, generals, and courtiers who had followed
Charlemagne thither; warriors from all parts
of the empire, with their corslets and winged helmets
of steel and their uniforms of divers colors;
civic functionaries in their gorgeous robes of office;
dignitaries of the church in their rich vestments;
a long array of priests in their white dalmatics,
until all Christendom seemed present in its noblest
and most showy representatives. Heathendom may
have been represented also, for it may be that messengers
from the great caliph of Bagdad, the
renowned Haroun al Raschid, the hero of the "Arabian
Nights' Entertainments," were present in the
church. Many members of the royal family of
Charlemagne were present to lend dignity to the
scene, and towering above them all was the great
Charles himself, probably clad in Roman costume,
his garb as a patrician of the imperial city, which
dignity had been conferred upon him. Loud plaudits
welcomed him as he rose into view. There were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
many present who had seen him at the head of his
army, driving before him hosts of flying Saracens,
Saxons, Lombards, and Avars, and to them he was
the embodiment of earthly power, the mighty
patron of the church, and the scourge of pagans
and infidels; and as they gazed on his noble form
and dignified face it seemed to some of them as if
they looked with human eyes on the face and form
of a representative of the Deity.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p63" id="p63"></a>
<img src="images/p63.jpg" alt="THE CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">THE CORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE.</span>
</div>

<p>A solemn mass was sung, with all the impressive
ceremony suitable to the occasion. As the king
rose to his feet, or while he still kneeled before the
altar and the "confession,"&mdash;the tomb of St. Peter,&mdash;the
pope, as if moved by a sudden impulse, took
up a splendid crown which lay upon the altar, and
placed it on his brow, saying, in a loud voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Long life and victory to Charles, the most pious
Augustus, crowned by God the great and pacific
Emperor of the Romans!"</p>

<p>At once, as if this were a signal for the breaking
of the constrained silence, a mighty shout rose from
the whole vast assembly. Again and again it was
repeated, and then broke out the solemn chant of
the litany, sung by hundreds of voices, while Charlemagne
stood in dignified and patient silence.
Whether or not this act of the pope was a surprise
to him we have no assurance. Eginhard tells us
that he declared that he would not have entered the
church that day if he had foreseen the pope's intentions;
yet it is not easy to believe that he was ignorant
of or non-consenting to the coming event. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the close of the chant Leo prostrated himself at the
feet of Charlemagne, and paid him adoration, as
had been the custom in the days of the old emperors.
He then anointed him with holy oil. And from
that day forward Charles, "giving up the title of
patrician, bore that of emperor and Augustus."</p>

<p>The ceremonies ended in the presentation from
the emperor to the church of a great silver table,
and, in conjunction with his son Charles and his
daughters, of golden vessels belonging to the table
of five hundred pounds' weight. This great gift
was followed, on the Feast of the Circumcision, with
a superb golden corona to be suspended over the
altar. It was ornamented with gems, and contained
fifty pounds of gold. On the Feast of the Epiphany
he added three golden chalices, weighing forty-two
pounds, and a golden paten of twenty-two pounds'
weight. To the other churches also, and to the
pope, he made magnificent gifts, and added three
thousand pounds of silver to be distributed among
the poor.</p>

<p>Thus, after more than three centuries, the title of
Augustus was restored to the western world. It
was destined to be held many centuries thereafter
by the descendants of Charlemagne. After the
division of his empire into France and Germany,
the imperial title was preserved in the latter realm,
the fiction&mdash;for it was little more&mdash;that an emperor
of the west existed being maintained down to the
present century.</p>

<p>As to the influence exerted by the power and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
dominion of Charlemagne on the minds of his contemporaries
and successors, many interesting stories
might be told. Fable surrounded him, legend
attached to his deeds, and at a later date he shared
the honor given to the legendary King Arthur of
England, of being made a hero of romance, a leading
character in many of those interminable
romances of chivalry which formed the favorite
reading of the medi&aelig;val age.</p>

<p>But we need not go beyond his own century to
find him a hero of romance. The monk of the
abbey of St. Gall, in Switzerland, whose story of
the defences of the land of the Avars we have
already quoted, has left us a chronicle full of surprising
tales of the life and doings of Charles the
Great. One of these may be of interest, as an
example of the kind of history with which our
ancestors of a thousand years ago were satisfied.</p>

<p>Charlemagne was approaching with his army
Pavia, the capital of the Lombards. Didier, the
king, was greatly disquieted at his approach. With
him was Ogier the Dane (Ogger the monk calls
him), one of the most famous captains of Charlemagne,
and a prominent hero of romance. He had
quarrelled with the king and had taken refuge with
the king of the Lombards. Thus goes on the chronicler
of St. Gall:</p>

<p>"When Didier and Ogger heard that the dread
monarch was coming, they ascended a tower of vast
height, where they could watch his arrival from afar
off and from every quarter. They saw, first of all,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
engines of war such as must have been necessary for
the armies of Darius or Julius C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>"'Is not Charles,' asked Didier of Ogger, 'with
this great army?'</p>

<p>"But the other answered, 'No.' The Lombard,
seeing afterwards an immense body of soldiery
gathered from all quarters of the vast empire, said
to Ogger, 'Certainly, Charles advances in triumph
in the midst of this throng.'</p>

<p>"'No, not yet; he will not appear so soon,' was
the answer.</p>

<p>"'What should we do, then,' rejoined Didier,
who began to be perturbed, 'should he come accompanied
by a larger band of warriors?'</p>

<p>"'You will see what he is when he comes,' replied
Ogger; 'but as to what will become of us I know
nothing.'</p>

<p>"As they were thus parleying, appeared the body
of guards that knew no repose; and at this sight
the Lombard, overcome with dread, cried, 'This
time it is surely Charles.'</p>

<p>"'No," answered Ogger, 'not yet.'</p>

<p>"In their wake came the bishops, the abbots, the
ordinaries of the chapels royal, and the counts;
and then Didier, no longer able to bear the light of
day or to face death, cried out with groans, 'Let us
descend and hide ourselves in the bowels of the
earth, far from the face and the fury of so terrible
a foe.'</p>

<p>"Trembling the while, Ogger, who knew by experience
what were the power and might of Charles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and who had learned the lesson by long consuetude
in better days, then said, 'When you shall behold
the crops shaking for fear in the fields, and the
gloomy Po and the Ticino overflowing the walls of
the city with their waves blackened with steel, then
may you think that Charles is coming.'</p>

<p>"He had not ended these words when there began
to be seen in the west, as it were a black cloud
raised by the north-west wind or by Boreas, which
turned the brightest day into awful shadows. But
as the emperor drew nearer and nearer, the gleam
of arms caused to shine on the people shut up within
the city a day more gloomy than any kind of night.
And then appeared Charles himself, that man of
steel, with his head encased in a helmet of steel,
his hands garnished with gauntlets of steel, his heart
of steel and his shoulders of marble protected by a
cuirass of steel, and his left hand armed with a
lance of steel which he held aloft in the air, for as
to his right hand, he kept that continually on the
hilt of his invincible sword. The outside of his
thighs, which the rest, for their greater ease in
mounting on horseback, were wont to leave unshackled
even by straps, he wore encircled by plates
of steel. What shall I say concerning his boots?
All the army were wont to have them invariably of
steel; on his buckler there was naught to be seen
but steel; his horse was of the color and the
strength of steel.</p>

<p>"All those who went before the monarch, all
those who marched by his side, all those who followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
after, even the whole mass of the army, had
armor of the like sort, so far as the means of each
permitted. The fields and the highways were covered
with steel; the points of steel reflected the
rays of the sun; and this steel, so hard, was borne
by people with hearts still harder. The flash of
steel spread terror throughout the streets of the
city. 'What steel! alack, what steel!' Such were
the bewildered cries the citizens raised. The firmness
of manhood and of youth gave way at sight
of the steel; and the steel paralyzed the wisdom
of graybeards. That which I, poor tale-teller,
mumbling and toothless, have attempted to depict
in a long description, Ogger perceived at one rapid
glance, and said to Didier, 'Here is what you so
anxiously sought,' and whilst uttering these words
he fell down almost lifeless."</p>

<p>If our sober chronicler of the ninth century could
thus let his imagination wander in speaking of the
great king, what wonder that the romancers of a
later age took Charlemagne and his Paladins as
fruitful subjects for their wildly fanciful themes!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-7" id="h2-7"></a><h2><i>PETER THE HERMIT.</i></h2>

<p>In the last decade of the eleventh century there
might have been seen, wandering through every part
of France and Germany, a man of singular appearance.
Small of stature, almost dwarfish in size,
emaciated by rigid austerities, angular and ungainly
in form, clad in a woollen tunic over which he wore
a serge cloak that came down to his heels, his head
and feet bare, and mounted on an ass that seemed to
have practised the same austerities as its master,
this singular person rode up and down the land,
rousing everywhere as he went the wildest enthusiasm.
Miserable as he seemed in body, he was a
man of active and earnest mind, of quick intellect,
keen and penetrating eye, and an ease, fluency, and
force of speech that gave him the power to sway
multitudes and stir up the soul of Europe as no
man before him had ever done.</p>

<p>This man was Peter the Hermit, the father of the
Crusades. He had been a soldier in his youth;
afterwards a married man and father of a family;
later a monk and recluse; then a pilgrim to Jerusalem,
now he was an envoy from Simeon, patriarch
of Jerusalem, to arouse the nations of Europe with
the story of the cruelties to which Christian pilgrims
were subjected by the barbarous Turks.</p>

<p>The pope, Urban II., had blessed his enterprise;
and then, dressed and mounted as described, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
bearing in his arms a huge cross, the inspired envoy
rode throughout the Teutonic lands, everywhere
recounting with vehement speech and with the force
of fiery indignation the sufferings of the Christians
and the barbarities of the Turks, and calling on all
pious souls to take arms in defence of the Holy
Sepulchre and for the emancipation of the Holy
Land from infidel control.</p>

<p>"We saw him at that time," says Guibert de
Nogent; his contemporary, "scouring city and town,
and preaching everywhere. The people crowded
around him, heaped presents upon him, and celebrated
his sanctity by such great praises that I
remember not that like honor was ever rendered to
any other person. In all that he did or said he
seemed to have in him something divine, insomuch
that people went so far as to pluck hairs from his
mule to keep as relics."</p>

<p>Never had mankind been more excited. All
Europe was aroused, indignant, fiery. The Holy
Sepulchre must be rescued, Palestine must be in the
hands of the Christians, the infidel Turks must be
driven from that sacred soil and punished for the
indignities they had heaped upon pilgrims, Europe
must march to Asia, and win salvation by driving
the unbelieving barbarian from the land sanctified
by the feet of Christ.</p>

<p>Everywhere men rose, seized their arms and prepared
for the march, of whose length and dangers
few of them dreamed. "The most distant islands
and savage countries," says William of Malmesbury,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
"were inspired by this ardent passion. The Welshman
left his hunting, the Scotchman his fellowship
with vermin, the Dane his drinking-party, the Norwegian
his raw fish." So far extended the story of
the mission of Peter the Hermit; while in France,
Germany, and the other lands in which he made his
indignant and fiery appeals, the whole population
seemed ready to rise and march <i>en masse</i> to the Holy
Land.</p>

<p>In 1095, taking advantage of this enthusiasm,
Urban II., the pope, called a council at Clermont, in
Auvergne, where numbers of clergymen and multitudes
of people assembled. Here, after the council,
the pope mounted a platform which rose in the
midst of a great open space, and around which
extended a vast throng of knights, nobles, and common
people. Peter the Hermit stood by the pope's
side, and told the story of the miseries and humiliations
of the Christians in Jerusalem in that fiery
and fluent oratory which had stirred the soul of all
Europe. Pope Urban followed in an impassioned
address, recounting the sufferings of the Christian
pilgrims, and calling upon the people of France to
rise for their deliverance.</p>

<p>"Men of France," he said, "men from beyond the
mountains, nations chosen and beloved of God, right
valiant knights, recall the virtues of your ancestors,
the virtue and greatness of King Charlemagne and
your other kings; it is from you above all that
Jerusalem awaits the help she invokes, for to you,
above all nations, God has vouchsafed signal glory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in arms. Christians, put an end to your own misdeeds
and let concord reign among you while in
those distant lands. If necessary, your bodies will
redeem your souls.... These things I publish
and command, and for their execution I appoint
the end of the coming spring."</p>

<p>His eloquent words roused the mass to madness.
From the throng rose one general cry, "God wills
it! God wills it!" Again and again it was repeated
as if it would never end, while swords waving
in the air, banners floating on high, and every indication
of applause and approval, attested the excitement
and enthusiasm of the crowd.</p>

<p>"If the Lord God were not in your soul, you
would not all have uttered the same words," cried
the pope, when he could make himself heard. "In
the battle, then, be those your war-cry, those words
that came from God. In the army of our Lord
let nought be heard but that one shout, 'God wills
it! God wills it!' Whosoever hath a wish to enter
upon this pilgrimage, let him wear upon his breast
or his brow the cross of the Lord, and let him who,
in accomplishment of his desire, shall be willing
to march away, place the cross behind him, between
his shoulders; for thus he will fulfil the precept of
the Lord, who said, 'He that doth not take up his
cross and follow me, is not worthy of me.'"</p>

<p>These words aroused a new enthusiasm. The desire
to assume the cross spread like a contagion
through the crowd. Adhemar, bishop of Puy, was
the first to receive it from the pope's hands. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
emblem was of red cloth, sewed on the right shoulder
of the coat, or fastened on the front of the helmet.
In haste the crowd sought materials to make it.
The passion for wearing the cross spread like wild
fire through Europe. Peter the Hermit, seconded
by the pope, had given birth to the Crusades.</p>

<p>The first outburst of enthusiasm was, as always,
the strongest. It has been said that in the spring
of 1096 six million souls took the road to Palestine.
This is, doubtless, a vast exaggeration, but great
numbers set out, and an immense multitude of ignorant
and enthusiastic people pushed tumultuously
towards the Holy Land, in advance of the organized
armies of the First Crusade.</p>

<p>As early as the 8th of March, 1096, great mobs&mdash;they
cannot fairly be called armies&mdash;began their
journey towards Palestine. They were not only
composed of armed men; women and children made
up part of them; whole families abandoned their
villages; and without organization or provisions, or
a knowledge of what lay before them, the ignorant
and enthusiastic mass pushed onward with unquestioning
faith.</p>

<p>The first body of these enthusiasts, led by a poor
knight called Walter the Penniless, was cut to pieces
by the natives of Bulgaria, a few only reaching Constantinople.
A second multitude, forty thousand
strong, was headed by Peter the Hermit. It was
similar in character to the preceding. Whenever
a town came in sight on their way, the children
eagerly asked if that were Jerusalem. The elders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
were little better informed. Onward they went,
through Hungary, through Bulgaria, through the
provinces of the Greek empire, everywhere committing
excesses, everywhere treated as enemies by
the incensed people, until the line of march was
strewn with their dead bodies. Peter the Hermit
sought to check their excesses, but in vain; and
when, at length, a miserable remnant of them
reached Constantinople, the Emperor Alexius
hastened to convey them across the Bosphorus, to
save the suburbs of his city from their ravages.
</p>
<p>In Asia Minor they were assailed by the Turks,
and numbers of them slain; and when, in the spring
of the next year, Godfrey de Bouillon and the other
Crusader chiefs, with a real army of knights and
men-at-arms, reached that locality, and marched
to besiege Nic&aelig;a, the first important Turkish stronghold
on their line of march, they saw coming to
meet them a miserable band, with every indication
of woful destitution, at whose head appeared Peter
the Hermit. It was the handful of destitute wanderers
that remained from the hundreds of thousands
who had set out with such high hopes a year
before.</p>

<p>Thus began that great movement from Europe
towards Asia, which was to continue for several
centuries, and end at length in disaster and defeat.
But we are concerned here only with Peter the
Hermit, and the conclusion of his career. He had
set the flood in motion; how far was he to be borne
on its waves?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
</p>
<p>The chiefs of the army welcomed him with respect
and consideration, and heard with interest and feeling
his account of the misfortunes of those under
his leadership, and how they were due to their own
ignorance, violence, and insubordination. With the
few who survived from the multitude he joined the
crusading army, and regained the ardent hopes
which had almost vanished from his heart.</p>

<p>The army that reached Nic&aelig;a is said to have
been six hundred thousand strong, though they were
probably not nearly so many. On they went with
many adventures, meeting the Turks in battle, suffering
from hunger and thirst, enduring calamities,
losing many by death, until at length the great city
of Antioch was reached and besieged.</p>

<p>Here at first food was plenty and life easy. But
the Turks held out, winter came, provisions grew
scarce, life ceased to be agreeable. Such was the
discouragement that succeeded that several men of
note deserted the army of the cross, among them
Robert, duke of Normandy, William, viscount of
Melun, called the <i>Carpenter</i>, from his mighty battle-axe,
and Peter the Hermit himself. Their flight
caused the greatest indignation. Tancred, one of
the leaders, hurried after and overtook them, and
brought them back to the camp, where they, overcome
by shame, swore on the Gospel never again
to abandon the cause of the cross.</p>

<p>In time Antioch was taken, and the Turks therein
massacred. But, unknown to the Crusaders, an immense
army of Turks was being organized in Syria
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
for its relief; and four days after its capture the
Crusaders found themselves in their turn besieged,
the place being completely enclosed.</p>

<p>Day by day the blockade became more strict.
Suffering from want of food began. Starvation
threatened the citizens and the army alike. It
seemed as if the crusade might end there and then,
in the death or captivity of all concerned in it;
when an incident, esteemed miraculous, roused the
spirits of the soldiers and achieved their deliverance.</p>

<p>A priest of Marseilles, Peter Bartholomew by
name, presented himself before the chief and said
that he had had a marvellous dream. St. Andrew
had thrice appeared to him, saying, "Go into the
church of my brother Peter at Antioch, and hard
by the high altar thou wilt find, on digging up the
ground, the head of the spear which pierced our
Redeemer's side. That, carried in front of the
army, will bring about the deliverance of the
Christians."</p>

<p>The search was made, a spear-head was found,
hope, confidence, enthusiasm were restored, and with
loud shouts the half-starved multitude demanded
that they should be led against the enemy. But before
doing so, the chiefs decided to apprise the
leader of the Turks of their intention, and for this
purpose chose Peter the Hermit as their boldest and
ablest speaker.</p>

<p>Peter, therefore, under a flag of truce, sought the
Turkish camp, presented himself without any mark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of respect before Corbogh&acirc;, the leader of the Turks,
and his captains, and boldly told them the decision
of the crusading chiefs.</p>

<p>"They offer thee," he said, "the choice between
divers determinations: either that thou appear alone
in person to fight with one of our princes, in order
that, if victorious, thou mayst obtain all thou canst
demand, or, if vanquished, thou mayst remain quiet;
or again, pick out divers of thine who shall fight, on
the same terms, with the same number of ours; or,
lastly, agree that the two armies shall prove, one
against the other, the fortune of battle."</p>

<p>Corbogh&acirc; received this challenge as an amusing
jest, saying that the chiefs must be in a desperate
state to send him such a proposition. "Go, and
tell these fools," he said, "that all whom I shall find
in full possession of all the powers of the manly
age shall have their lives, and shall be reserved by
me for my master's service, and that all others shall
fall beneath my sword, as useless trees, so that there
shall remain of them not even a faint remembrance.
Had I not deemed it more convenient to destroy
them by famine than to smite them with the sword,
I should already have gotten forcible mastery of
the city, and they would have reaped the fruits
of their voyage hither by undergoing the law of
vengeance."</p>

<p>Corbogh&acirc; spoke much too hastily. Before night
of the next day he was a helpless fugitive, his army
destroyed or dispersed. Peter the Hermit returned
with his message, but, by the advice of Godfrey de
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Bouillon, he simply announced that the Turks desired
battle, and that instant preparation for it must
be made. On the next day the whole Christian
army, armed and enthusiastic, issued from the city,
a part of the clergy marching at their head, the
miraculous spear-head borne before them, and
attacked the Turks in their camp. The battle was
long, fierce, and stubborn, but in the end the Turks
gave way before the fury of Christian enthusiasm,
and fled for their lives, vast multitudes of them
being slain on the field, while the vain-glorious
Corbogh&acirc; rode in all haste, with a weak escort,
towards far-off Bagdad.</p>

<p>The camp of the Turks was taken and pillaged.
It yielded fifteen thousand camels and an unnamed
multitude of horses. The tent of Corbogh&acirc; proved
a rich prize. It was laid out in streets, flanked by
towers, in imitation of a fortified town, was everywhere
enriched with gold and precious stones, and
was so spacious that it would have contained more
than two thousand persons. It was sent to Italy,
where it was long preserved. So great was the spoil
that, says Albert of Aix, "every Crusader found
himself richer than he had been at starting from
Europe."</p>

<p>In June, 1099, the Crusaders arrived before
Jerusalem, and saw with eyes of wonder and delight
the vision of the Holy City which they had come so
far to gaze upon. After a month of siege the chiefs
fixed a day for the grand assault, and on the day
preceding that chosen the whole army marched, fasting,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and preceded by their priests, in slow procession
round the walls, halting at every hallowed spot,
listening to the hymns and exhortations of their
priests, and looking upward with wrathful eyes at
the insults heaped by the Islamites upon the cross
and other symbols of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>"Ye see," cried Peter the Hermit, "the blasphemies
of God's enemies. Now, this I swear to
you by your faith; this I swear to you by the arms
you carry; to-day these infidels are still full of
pride and insolence, but to-morrow they shall be
frozen with fear; those mosques, which tower over
Christian ruins, shall serve for temples to the true
God, and Jerusalem shall hear no longer aught but
the praises of the Lord."</p>

<p>His words were received with shouts of applause
by the whole army. His had been the first voice to
call Europe to the deliverance of the Holy City;
now, with a strong army to back him, he gazed on
the walls of Jerusalem, still in the hands of the
infidels, likely soon to be in the hands of the Christians.
Well might he feel joy and self-gratification,
in thinking that all this was his work, and that he
had been the apostle of the greatest event in modern
history.</p>

<p>On the next day, July 14, 1099, the assault began
at daybreak. On Friday, the 15th, Jerusalem fell
into the hands of the Crusaders, and the mission of
Peter the Hermit was accomplished, the Holy City
was won.</p>

<p>With that great day ended the active part played
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
by Peter the Hermit in history. He was received
with the greatest respect by the Christian dwellers
in Jerusalem, who exerted themselves to render him
the highest honors, and attributed to him alone,
after God, their deliverance from the sufferings
which they had so long endured. On his return
to Europe he founded a monastery near Hue, in the
diocese of Li&eacute;ge, where he spent the remainder of
his life in retirement, respected and honored by all,
and died there on the 11th of July, 1115.

<a name="h2-8" id="h2-8"></a><h2><i>THE COMMUNE OF LAON.</i></h2>

<p>The history of the kingdoms of Europe has a
double aspect, that of the arrogant rule of kings
and nobles, and that of the enforced submission
and occasional insurrection of the common people,
whom the governing class despised while subsisting
on the products of their labor, as a tree draws its
nutriment from the base soil above which it proudly
rises. Insurrections of the peasantry took place
at times, we have said, though, as a rule, nothing
was gained by them but blows and bloodshed. We
have described such outbreaks in England. France
had its share of them, all of which were speedily
and cruelly suppressed. It was not by armed insurrection
that the peasantry gained the measure
of liberty they now possess. Their gradual emancipation
was gained through unceasing protest and
steady pressure, and in no sense by revolt and
bloodshed.</p>

<p>A different story must be told of the towns. In
these the common people were concentrated and
well organized, and possessed skilled leaders and
strong walls. They understood the political situation,
struck for a definite purpose, and usually
gained it. The history of nearly every town in
France tells of some such demand for chartered
privileges, ordinarily ending in the freeing of the
town from the tyranny of the nobles. Each town
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
had its municipal government, the <i>Commune</i>. It
was this body which spoke for the burghers, which
led in the struggle for liberty, and which succeeded
in gaining for most of the towns a charter of rights
and privileges. Many stirring incidents might be
told of this fight for freedom. We shall confine
ourselves to the story of the revolt of the Commune
of Laon, of which a sprightly contemporary description
exists.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p82" id="p82"></a>
<img src="images/p82.jpg" alt="A MARRIAGE FEAST IN BRITTANY." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">A MARRIAGE FEAST IN BRITTANY.</span>
</div>

<p>At the end of the eleventh century Laon was a
bustling and important city. It was the seat of a
cathedral and under the government of a bishop;
was wealthy and prosperous, stirring and turbulent;
was the gathering-place of the surrounding people,
the centre of frequent disturbances. Thierry draws
a vivid picture of the state of affairs existing within
its walls. "The nobles and their servitors," he
says, "sword in hand, committed robbery upon the
burghers; the streets of the town were not safe by
night nor even by day, and none could go out without
running a risk of being stopped and robbed or
killed. The burghers in their turn committed violence
upon the peasants, who came to buy or sell
at the market of the town."</p>

<p>Truly, town life and country life alike were
neither safe nor agreeable in those charming medi&aelig;val
days when chivalry was the profession of all
and the possession of none, when the nobility were
courteous in word and violent in deed, and when
might everywhere lorded it over right, and conscience
was but another word for desire. As for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the treatment of the peasantry by the townsmen, we
may quote from Guibert, an abbot of Nogent-sous-Coucy,
to whose lively pen we owe all we have to
tell about Laon.</p>

<p>"Let me give as example," he says, "a single fact,
which had it taken place among the Barbarians or
the Scythians would assuredly have been considered
the height of wickedness, in the judgment even
of those who know no law. On Saturday the inhabitants
of the country places used to leave their fields
and come from all sides to Laon to get provisions
at the market. The townsfolk used then to go
round the place carrying in baskets or bowls or
otherwise samples of vegetables or grain or any other
article, as if they wished to sell. They would offer
them to the first peasant who was in search of such
things to buy; he would promise to pay the price
agreed upon; and then the seller would say to the
buyer, 'Come with me to my house to see and
examine the whole of the articles I am selling you.'
The other would go; and then, when they came to
the bin containing the goods, the honest seller would
take off and hold up the lid, saying to the buyer,
'Step hither and put your head or arms into the
bin to make quite sure that it is all exactly the
same goods as I showed you outside.' And then
when the other, jumping on to the edge of the bin,
remained leaning on his belly, with his head and
shoulders hanging down, the worthy seller, who
kept in the rear, would hoist up the thoughtless
rustic by the feet, push him suddenly into the bin,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and, clapping on the lid as he fell, keep him shut
up in this safe prison until he had bought himself
out."</p>

<p>This has more the aspect of a practical joke than
an act of barbarism. But withal, between the cheating
of the peasantry by the burghers, the robbery of
the burghers by the nobles, and the general turmoil
and terror, there might have been found more delightful
places of residence than the good city of
Laon in the eleventh century. The story of this
city is a long one. We are here concerned with but
one episode in the tale.</p>

<p>In the year 1106 the bishopric of Laon, which
had been for two years vacant, was bought by
Gaudri, a Norman by birth, and a man of no very
savory reputation. He was a clergyman with the
habits of a soldier, hasty and arrogant in disposition,
hurrying through the service of the mass,
and dallying with delight over narratives of fighting
and hunting, one of the churchmen of wickedly
worldly tastes of which those days presented so
many examples.</p>

<p>Laon soon learned something of the character of
its new bishop. Not long was he in office before
outrages began. He seized one man whom he suspected
of aiding his enemies, and put out his eyes.
Another was murdered in the church itself, with his
connivance. In his deeds of violence or vengeance
he employed a black slave, imitating in this some of
the Crusaders, who brought with them such servants
from the east. No lawless noble could have shown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
more disregard of law or justice than this dignitary
of the church, and the burghers of Laon viewed
with growing indignation his lawless and merciless
course.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the absence of Bishop Gaudri
in England, the burghers bribed the clergy and
knights who governed in his stead, and obtained
from them the privilege of choosing their own
rulers. "The clergy and knights," we are told,
"came to an agreement with the common folk in
hopes of enriching themselves in a speedy and easy
fashion." A commune was set up, and given the
necessary powers and immunities.</p>

<p>Gaudri returned, and heard with fierce wrath of
what had been done in his absence. For several
days he stayed outside the walls, clouding and thundering.
Then the burghers applied the same plaster
to his wrath as they had done to the virtue of
his representatives. They offered him money,
"enough to appease the tempest of his words."
He accepted the bribe and swore to respect the
commune. This done, he entered the city in state.</p>

<p>The burghers knew him somewhat too well to
trust him. There were higher powers in France
than Bishop Gaudri, which were known to be susceptible
to the same mercenary argument. A deputation
was therefore sent to King Louis the Fat at
Paris, laden with rich presents, and praying for a
royal confirmation of the commune. The king
loved the glitter of cash; he accepted the presents,
swore that the commune should be respected, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
gave Laon a charter sealed with the great seal of
the crown. All that the citizens were to do in
return, beyond meeting the customary crown claims,
was to give the king three lodgings a year, if he
came to the town, or in lieu thereof, if he failed to
come, twenty livres for each lodging.</p>

<p>For three years all went well in Laon. The burghers
were happy in their security and proud of
their liberty, while clergy and knights were occupied
in spending the money they had received. The
year 1112 came. The bishop and his subordinates
had got rid of their money, and craved again the
power they had sold. They began to consider how
the citizens might once more be made serfs. They
would not have hesitated long but for that inconvenient
grant of Louis the Fat. But King Louis
might be managed. He was normally avaricious.
The bishop invited him to Laon to take part in the
keeping of Holy Week, trusting to get his aid to
overthrow the commune.</p>

<p>The king came. The burghers were not long in
suspecting the cause of his coming. They offered
him some four hundred livres to confirm them in
their liberties. The bishop and his party offered
him seven hundred livres to restore their power.
The higher offer prevailed. The charter was annulled,
and the magistrates of the commune were
ordered to cease from their functions, to give up the
seal and the banner of the town, and no more to
ring the belfry-chimes which indicated the beginning
and the ending of their sessions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
</p>
<p>Wrath and uproar succeeded this decree. The
burghers had tasted the sweets of liberty, and were
not ready to lose their dearly-bought independence.
So violent were they that the king himself was
frightened, and hastily left his hotel for the stronger
walls of the episcopal palace. At dawn of the next
day, partly in fear and perhaps partly in shame, he
departed from Laon with all his train, leaving the
Easter festival to take place without him.
</p>
<p>It was destined to be a serious festival for Bishop
Gaudri and his crew of base-souled followers. The
king had left a harvest of indignation behind him.
On the day after his going all shops and taverns
were kept closed and nothing was sold; every one
remained at home, nursing his wrath. The next day
the anger of the citizens grew more demonstrative.
A rumor spread that the bishop and grandees were
busy calculating the fortunes of the citizens, that
they might force from them the sum promised the
king. The burghers assembled in burning indignation,
and forty of them bound themselves by oath
to kill the bishop and all those who had aided him
to destroy the commune.</p>

<p>Some rumor of this got afloat. Anselm, the arch-deacon,
warned the bishop that his life was in danger,
and urged him not to leave his house, and, in
particular, not to accompany the procession on
Easter-day. Thus C&aelig;sar had been warned, and had
contemned the warning. Gaudri emulated him, and
answered, with a sneer of contempt,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pooh! <i>I</i> die by the hands of such fellows!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
</p>
<p>Easter-day came. The bishop did not appear at
matins, or at the later church service. But, lest he
should be called coward, he joined the procession,
followed by his clergy and domestics, and by a
number of knights with arms and armor concealed
under their clothes. Slowly through the streets
moved the procession, the people looking on in lowering
silence. As it passed a dark arch one of the
forty rushed suddenly out, crying, "Commune!
commune!" No one joined him; the crowd
seemed intimidated; their feelings subsided in a
murmur; the procession continued on its way
undisturbed.</p>

<p>The next day another procession took place. This
day the bishop had filled the town with peasants,
who were charged to protect his church, his palace,
and himself. The people kept quiet. All went
well. Bishop Gaudri, satisfied that the talk of
danger was all a myth, now dismissed the peasants,
feeling quite secure.</p>

<p>"On the fourth day after Easter," says Guibert
of Nogent, "my corn having been pillaged in consequence
of the disorder that reigned in the town, I
repaired to the bishop, and prayed him to put a stop
to this state of violence.</p>

<p>"'What do you suppose,' said he to me, 'these
fellows can do with all their outbreaks? Why, if
my blackamoor, John, were to pull the nose of the
most formidable amongst them, the poor devil durst
not even grumble. Have I not forced them to give
up what they called their commune, for the whole
duration of my life?'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I held my tongue," adds Guibert; "many folks
besides me warned him of his danger, but he would
not deign to believe anybody."</p>

<p>For three days all kept quiet. The bishop and
his myrmidons busied themselves in calculating
how much cash they could squeeze from the people.
The people lowered like a gathering storm. All at
once the storm broke. A sudden tumult arose;
crowds filled the streets. "Commune! commune!"
was the general cry; as if by magic, swords, lances,
axes, bows, and clubs appeared in the hands of the
people; with wild shouts of vengeance they rushed
through the streets and burst into the bishop's
palace. The knights who had promised to protect
him hastened thither and faced the infuriated populace.
The first three who appeared were hotly
attacked and fell before the axes of the burghers.
The others held back. In a few minutes more
flames appeared in the palace, and in no long time
it was a mass of seething fire. The day of vengeance
had come.</p>

<p>The bishop had fled to the church. Here, having
no means of defence, he hastily put on the dress of
one of his servants and repaired to the church cellar,
where were a number of empty casks. One of these
he got into, a faithful follower then heading him in,
and even stopping up the bung-hole. Meanwhile,
the crowd were in eager quest for the object of their
wrath. The palace had been searched before being
set on fire; the church and all accompanying buildings
now swarmed with revengeful burghers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Among these was a bandit named Teutgaud, a fellow
notorious for his robberies and murders of travellers,
but now hand and glove with the commune.
The bishop had named him <i>Isengrin</i>, the by-word
then for wolf.</p>

<p>This worthy made his way into the cellar, followed
by an armed crowd. Through this they went,
tapping the casks as they proceeded. Teutgaud
halted in front of that in which the bishop was
concealed&mdash;on what suspicion does not appear.</p>

<p>"Knock in the head of this," he ordered.</p>

<p>He was quickly obeyed.</p>

<p>"Is there any one here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only a poor prisoner," came a quavering voice
from the depths of the cask.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Teutgaud; "so it is you,
Master Isengrin, who are hiding here!"</p>

<p>Seizing the trembling bishop by the hair, he
dragged him without ceremony from the cask. The
frightened culprit fell on his knees and begged
piteously for his life. He would do anything; he
would give up the bishopric, yield them all the
money he had, and leave the country.</p>

<p>Insults and blows were the only replies. In a
minute more the unfortunate man was dead. Teutgaud,
true to his profession, cut off his ringer to
obtain the episcopal ring that glittered on it.
Stripped of its clothing, the body was hurled into
a corner, and the furious throng flung stones and
mud at it, as the only vent remaining to their revengeful
passions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>All that day and the night that followed the armed
and maddened townsmen searched the streets and
houses of Laon for the supporters of the murdered
bishop, and numbers of them shared his fate. Not
the guilty alone, but many of the innocent, perished
before the blind wrath of the multitude. "The
progress of the fire," says Guibert, "kindled on two
sides at once, was so rapid, and the winds drove
the flames so furiously in the direction of the convent
of St. Vincent, that the monks were afraid
of seeing all they possessed become the fire's prey,
and all the persons who had taken refuge in this
monastery trembled as if they had seen swords
hanging over their heads."</p>

<p>It was a day and night of frightful excess, one of
those dread occasions which arise when men are
roused to violence by injustice, and for the time
break all the bonds of mercy and moderation which
ordinarily control them. Regret at their insensate
rage is sure to succeed all such outbreaks. Retribution
is likely to follow. Consternation came to
the burghers of Laon when calm thought returned
to them. They had defied the king. What would
he do? To protect themselves they added to the
burden of their offences, summoning to their aid
Thomas de Marle, the son of Lord Enguerraud de
Coucy, a man who was little better than a brigand,
and with a detestable reputation for cruelty and
ferocity.</p>

<p>De Marle was not quite ready to undertake this
task. He consulted his people, who declared that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
it would be folly for their small force to seek to
defend such a city against the king. He thereupon
induced the burghers to meet him in a field, about
a mile from the city, where he would make answer
to their request. When they had come, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Laon is the head of the kingdom; it is impossible
for me to keep the king from making himself
master of it. If you fear his arms, follow me to my
own land, and you will find in me a protector and
a friend."</p>

<p>Their consternation was extreme at this advice.
For the time being they were in a panic, through
fear of the king's vengeance, and the conference
ended in many of them taking the advice of the
Lord of Marle, and flying with him to his stronghold.
Teutgaud was among the number that
accepted his protection.</p>

<p>The news of their flight quickly spread to the
country places around Laon. The story went that
the town was quite deserted. The peasants, filled
with hopes of plunder, hastened to the town, took
possession of what empty houses they found, and
carried off what money and other valuables they
could discover. "Before long," says Guibert,
"there arose between the first and last comers
disputes about the partition of their plunder; all
that the small folks had taken soon passed into the
hands of the powerful; if two men met a third
quite alone they stripped him; the state of the town
was truly pitiable. The burghers who had quitted
it with Thomas de Marle had beforehand destroyed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and burnt the houses of the clergy and grandees
whom they hated; and now the grandees, escaped
from the massacre, carried off in their turn from
the houses of the fugitives all means of subsistence
and all movables to the very hinges and bolts."</p>

<p>What succeeded must be briefly told. The story
of the events here described spread through the
kingdom. Thomas de Marle was put under ban by
the king and excommunicated by the church. Louis
raised an army and marched against him. De
Marle was helpless with illness, but truculent in
temper. He defied the king, and would not listen
to his summons. Louis attacked his castles, took
two of them, Crecy and Nogent, and in the end
forced him to buy pardon by a heavy ransom and an
indemnity to the church. As for the burghers who
had taken refuge with him, the king showed them
no mercy. They had had a hand in the murder
of Bishop Gaudri, and all of them were hung.</p>

<p>The remaining story of Laon is too long for our
space. The burghers continued to demand their
liberties, and in 1128 a new charter was granted
them. This they retained, except during some intervals,
until that later period when the medi&aelig;val
system of municipal government came to an end,
and all the cities and towns fell under the direct
control of the deputies of the king.

<a name="h2-9" id="h2-9"></a><h2><i>HOW BIG FERR&Eacute; FOUGHT
FOR FRANCE.</i></h2>

<p>It was in the heart of the Hundred Years' War.
Everywhere France lay desolate under the feet of
the English invaders. Never had land been more
torn and rent, and never with less right and justice.
Like a flock of vultures the English descended
upon the fair realm of France, ravaging as they
went, leaving ruin behind their footsteps, marching
hither and thither at will, now victorious, now
beaten, yet ever plundering, ever desolating.
Wherever they came the rich were ruined, the poor
were starved, want and misery stared each other in
the face, happy homes became gaping ruins, fertile
fields became sterile wastes. It was a pandemonium
of war, a frightful orgy of military license, a scene
to make the angels weep and demons rejoice over
the cruelty of man.</p>

<p>In the history of this dreadful business we find
little to show what part the peasantry took in the
affair, beyond that of mere suffering. The man-at-arms
lorded it in France; the peasant endured.</p>

<p>Yet occasionally this down-trodden sufferer took
arms against his oppressors, and contemporary
chronicles give us some interesting insight into
brave deeds done by the tiller of the soil. One of
these we propose to tell,&mdash;a stirring and romantic
one. It is half legendary, perhaps, yet there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
reason to believe that it is in the main true, and it
paints a vivid picture of those days of blood and
violence which is well worthy of reproduction.</p>

<p>In 1358 the king of Navarre, who had aided the
English in their raids, suddenly made peace with
France. This displeased his English allies, who
none the less, however, continued their destructive
raids, small parties marching hither and thither,
now victorious, now vanquished, an interminable
series of minor encounters taking the place of large
operations. Both armies were reduced to guerilla
bands, who fought as they met, and lived meanwhile
on the land and its inhabitants. The battle of
Poitiers had been recently fought, the king of France
was a prisoner, there was no organization, no central
power, in the realm, and wherever possible the population
took arms and fought in their own defence,
seeking some little relief from the evils of anarchy.</p>

<p>The scene of the story we propose to tell is a small
stronghold called Longueil, not far from Compi&egrave;gne
and near the banks of the Oise. It was pretty well
fortified, and likely to prove a point of danger to the
district if the enemy should seize it and make it a
centre of their plundering raids. There were no
soldiers to guard it, and the peasants of the vicinity,
Jacques Bonhomme (Jack Goodfellow) as they were
called, undertook its defence. This was no unauthorized
action. The lord-regent of France and
the abbot of the monastery of St. Corneille-de-Compi&egrave;gne,
near by, gave them permission, glad,
doubtless, to have even their poor aid, in the absence
of trained soldiery.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>In consequence, a number of the neighboring
tillers of the soil garrisoned the place, providing
themselves with arms and provisions, and promising
the regent to defend the town until death. Hither
came many of the villagers for security, continuing
the labors which yielded them a poor livelihood, but
making Longueil their stronghold of defence. In
all there were some two hundred of them, their
chosen captain being a tall, finely-formed man,
named William a-Larks (<i>aux Alouettes</i>). For servant,
this captain had a gigantic peasant, a fellow
of great stature, marvellous strength, and undaunted
boldness, and withal of extreme modesty.
He bore the name of Big Ferr&eacute;.</p>

<p>This action of the peasants called the attention of
the English to the place, and roused in them a desire
to possess it. <i>Jacques Bonhomme</i> was held by them
in utter contempt, and the peasant garrison simply
brought to their notice the advantage of the place
as a well-fortified centre of operations. That these
poor dirt delvers could hold their own against
trained warriors seemed a matter not worth a second
thought.</p>

<p>"Let us drive the base-born rogues from the town
and take possession of it," said they. "It will be a
trifle to do it, and the place will serve us well."</p>

<p>Such seemed the case. The peasants, unused to
war and lacking all military training, streamed in
and out at pleasure, leaving the gates wide open, and
taking no precautions against the enemy. Suddenly,
to their surprise and alarm, they saw a strong
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
body of armed men entering the open gates and
marching boldly into the court-yard of the stronghold,
the heedless garrison gazing with gaping eyes
at them from the windows and the inner courts.
It was a body of English men-at-arms, two hundred
strong, who had taken the unguarded fortress by
surprise.</p>

<p>Down came the captain, William a-Larks, to
whose negligence this surprise was due, and made
a bold and fierce assault on the invaders, supported
by a body of his men. But the English forced
their way inward, pushed back the defenders, surrounded
the captain, and quickly struck him to the
earth with a mortal wound. Defence seemed hopeless.
The assailants had gained the gates and the
outer court, dispersed the first party of defenders,
killed their captain, and were pushing their way
with shouts of triumph into the stronghold within.
The main body of the peasants were in the inner
court, Big Ferr&eacute; at their head, but it was beyond
reason to suppose that they could stand against this
compact and well-armed body of invaders.</p>

<p>Yet they had promised the regent to hold the
place until death, and they meant it.</p>

<p>"It is death fighting or death yielding," they
said. "These men will slay us without mercy;
let us sell them our lives at a dear price."</p>

<p>"Gathering themselves discreetly together," says
the chronicler, "they went down by different gates,
and struck out with mighty blows at the English, as
if they had been beating out their corn on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
threshing-floor; their arms went up and down
again, and every blow dealt out a mighty wound."</p>

<p>Big Ferr&eacute; led a party of the defenders against the
main body of the English, pushing his way into the
outer court where the captain had fallen. When he
saw his master stretched bleeding and dying on the
ground, the faithful fellow gave vent to a bitter cry,
and rushed with the rage of a lion upon the foe,
wielding a great axe like a feather in his hands.</p>

<p>The English looked with surprise and alarm on
this huge fellow, who topped them all in height by
a head and shoulders, and who came forward like
a maddened bull, uttering short, hoarse cries of rage,
while the heavy axe quivered in his vigorous grasp.
In a moment he was upon them, striking such quick
and deadly blows that the place before him was soon
void of living men. Of one man the head was
crushed; of another the arm was lopped off; a
third was hurled back with a gaping wound. His
comrades, seeing the havoc he was making, were
filled with ardor, and seconded him well, pressing
on the dismayed English and forcing them bodily
back. In an hour, says the chronicler, the vigorous
fellow had slain with his own hand eighteen of the
foe, without counting the wounded.</p>

<p>This was more than flesh and blood could bear.
The English turned to fly; some leaped in terror
into the ditches, others sought to regain the gates;
after them rushed Big Ferr&eacute;, still full of the rage of
battle. Reaching the point where the English had
planted their flag, he killed the bearer, seized the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
standard, and bade one of his followers to go and
fling it into the ditch, at a point where the wall
was not yet finished.</p>

<p>"I cannot," said the man; "there are still too
many English there."</p>

<p>"Follow me with the flag," said Big Ferr&eacute;.</p>

<p>Like a woodman making a lane through a thicket,
the burly champion cleared an avenue through the
ranks of the foe, and enabled his follower to hurl the
flag into the ditch. Then, turning back, he made
such havoc among the English who still remained
within the wall, that all who were able fled in
terror from his deadly axe. In a short time the
place was cleared and the gates closed, the English&mdash;such
of them as were left&mdash;making their way with
all haste from that fatal place. Of those who had
come, the greater part never went back. It is said
that the axe of Big Ferr&eacute; alone laid more than
forty of them low in death. In this number the
chronicler may have exaggerated, but the story as a
whole is probably true.</p>

<p>The sequel to this exploit of the giant champion
is no less interesting. The huge fellow whom steel
could not kill was slain by water,&mdash;not by drowning,
however, but by drinking. And this is how
it came to pass.</p>

<p>The story of the doings at Longueil filled the
English with shame and anger. When the bleeding
and exhausted fugitives came back and reported
the fate of their fellows, indignation and desire for
revenge animated all the English in the vicinity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
On the following day they gathered from all the
camps in the neighborhood and marched in force
on Longueil, bent on making the peasants pay
dearly for the slaughter of their comrades.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p100" id="p100"></a>
<img src="images/p100.jpg" alt="COLUMN OF JULY, PLACE DE LA BASTILLE." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">COLUMN OF JULY, PLACE DE LA BASTILLE.</span>
</div>

<p>This time they found entrance not so easy. The
gates were closed, the walls well manned. Big
Ferr&eacute; was now the captain of Longueil, and so little
did he or his followers fear the assaults of their
foes, that they sallied out boldly upon them, their
captain in the lead with his mighty axe.</p>

<p>Fierce was the fray that followed. The peasants
fought like tigers, their leader like a lion. The
English were broken, slaughtered, driven like sheep
before the burly champion and his bold followers.
Many were slain or sorely wounded. Numbers were
taken, among them some of the English nobles.
The remainder fled in a panic, not able to stand
against that vigorous arm and deadly axe, and the
fierce courage which the exploits of their leader
gave to the peasants. The field was cleared and
Longueil again saved.</p>

<p>Big Ferr&eacute;, overcome with heat and fatigue, sought
his home at the end of the fight, and there drank
such immoderate draughts of cold water that he was
seized with a fever. He was put to bed, but would
not part with his axe, "which was so heavy that a
man of the usual strength could scarcely lift it from
the ground with both hands." In this statement
one would say that the worthy chronicler must have
romanced a little.</p>

<p>The news that their gigantic enemy was sick came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to the ears of the English, and filled them with joy
and hope. He was outside the walls of Longueil,
and might be assailed in his bed. Twelve men-at-arms
were chosen, their purpose being to creep up
secretly upon the place, surround it, and kill the
burly champion before aid could come to him.</p>

<p>The plan was well laid, but it failed through the
watchfulness of the sick man's wife. She saw the
group of armed men before they could complete
their dispositions, and hurried with the alarming
news to the bedside of her husband.</p>

<p>"The English are coming!" she cried. "I fear
it is for you they are looking. What will you do?"</p>

<p>Big Ferr&eacute; answered by springing from bed, arming
himself in all haste despite his sickness, seizing
his axe, and leaving the house. Entering his little
yard, he saw the foe closing covertly in on his small
mansion, and shouted, angrily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, you scoundrels! you are coming to take me
in my bed. You shall not get me there; come, take
me here if you will."</p>

<p>Setting his back against a wall, he defended himself
with his usual strength and courage. The
English attacked him in a body, but found it impossible
to get inside the swing of that deadly axe.
In a little while five of them lay wounded upon the
ground, and the other seven had taken to flight.</p>

<p>Big Ferr&eacute; returned triumphantly to his bed;
but, heated by his exertions, he drank again too
freely of cold water. In consequence his fever returned,
more violently than before. A few days
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
afterwards the brave fellow, sinking under his sickness,
went out of the world, conquered by water
where steel had been of no avail. "All his comrades
and his country wept for him bitterly, for,
so long as he lived, the English would not have
come nigh this place."</p>

<p>And so ended the short but brilliant career of the
notable Big Ferr&eacute;, one of those peasant heroes who
have risen from time to time in all countries, yet
rarely have lived long enough to make their fame
enduring. His fate teaches one useful warning,
that imprudence is often more dangerous than
armed men.</p>

<p>We are told nothing concerning the fate of Longueil
after his death. Probably the English found
it an easy prey when deprived of the peasant champion,
who had held it so bravely and well; though
it may be that the wraith of the burly hero hung
about the place and still inspired his late companions
to successful resistance to their foes. Its fate
is one of those many half-told tales on which history
shuts its door, after revealing all that it holds to be
of interest to mankind.

<br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-10" id="h2-10"></a><h2><i>BERTRAND DU GUESCLIN.</i></h2>

<p>In the castle of Motte-Broon, near Rennes,
France, there was born about the year 1314 "the
ugliest child from Rennes to Dinan," as an uncomplimentary
chronicle says. He was a flat-nosed,
swarthy, big-headed, broad-shouldered fellow, a
regular wretch, in his own mother's words, violent
in temper, using his fist as freely as his tongue,
driving his tutor away before he could teach him
to read, but having no need to be taught to fight,
since this art came to him by nature. At sixteen
he fled from home to Rennes, where he entered
into adventures, quarrels, and challenges, and distinguished
himself by strength, courage, and a
strong sense of honor.</p>

<p>He quickly took part in the wars of the time,
showed his prowess in every encounter, and in the
war against Navarre, won the highest honors. At
a later date he engaged in the civil wars of Spain,
where he headed an army of thirty thousand men.
In the end the adventurers who followed him,
Burgundian, Picard, Champagnese, Norman, and
others, satisfied with their spoils, left him and
returned to France. Bertrand had but some fifteen
hundred men-at-arms remaining under his command
when a great peril confronted him. He was a supporter
of Henry of Transtamare, who was favorable
to France, and who had made him Constable of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Castile. This was not pleasing to Edward III. of
England. Don Pedro the Cruel, a king equally
despised and detested, had been driven from Castile
by the French allies of his brother Henry. Edward
III. determined to replace him on the throne,
and with this intent sent his son, the Black Prince,
with John Chandos, the ablest of the English leaders,
and an army of twenty-seven thousand men,
into the distracted kingdom.</p>

<p>A fierce battle followed on April 3, 1367. The
ill-disciplined soldiers of Henry were beaten and
put to rout. Du Guesclin and his men-at-arms
alone maintained the fight, with a courage that
knew no yielding. In the end they were partly
driven back, partly slain. Du Guesclin set his back
against a wall, and fought with heroic courage.
There were few with him. Up came the Prince
of Wales, saw what was doing, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentle marshals of France, and you too, Bertrand,
yield yourselves to me."</p>

<p>"Yonder men are my foes," exclaimed Don
Pedro, who accompanied the prince; "it is they
who took from me my kingdom, and on them I
mean to take vengeance."</p>

<p>He came near to have ended his career of vengeance
then and there. Du Guesclin, incensed at
his words, sprang forward and dealt him so furious
a blow with his sword as to hurl him fainting to
the ground. Then, turning to the prince, the
valiant warrior said, "Nathless, I give up my sword
to the most valiant prince on earth."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The prince took the sword, and turning to the
Captal of Buch, the Navarrese commander, whom
Bertrand had years before defeated and captured,
bade him keep the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Aha, Sir Bertrand," said the Captal, "you took
me at the battle of Cocherel, and to-day I've got
you."</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted Bertrand; "but at Cocherel I
took you myself, and here you are only my keeper."</p>

<p>Pedro was restored to the throne of Castile,&mdash;which
he was not long to hold,&mdash;and the Prince of
Wales returned to Bordeaux, bringing him his
prisoner. He treated him courteously enough, but
held him in strict captivity, and to Sir Hugh Calverley,
who begged that he would release him at a
ransom suited to his small estate, he answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have no wish for ransom from him. I will
have his life prolonged in spite of himself. If he
were released he would be in battle again, and always
making war."</p>

<p>And so Bertrand remained in captivity, until an
event occurred of which the chroniclers give us an
entertaining story. It is this event which it is our
purpose to relate.</p>

<p>A day came in which the Prince of Wales and his
noble companions, having risen from dinner, were
amusing themselves with narratives of daring deeds
of arms, striking love-passages, and others of the
tales with which the barons of that day were wont
to solace their leisure. The talk came round to the
story of how St. Louis, when captive in Tunis, had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
been ransomed with fine gold, paid down by weight.
At this point the prince spoke, somewhat unthinkingly.</p>

<p>"When a good knight is made prisoner in fair
feat of arms," he said, "and sworn to abide prisoner,
he should on no account depart without his master's
leave. But one should not demand such portion of
his substance in ransom as to leave him unable to
equip himself again."</p>

<p>The Sire de Lebret, who was friendly to Du
Guesclin, answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noble sire, be not angry if I relate what I have
heard said of you in your absence."</p>

<p>"By my faith," said the prince, "right little
should I love follower of mine, sitting at my table,
if he heard a word said against my honor and
apprised me not of it."</p>

<p>"Sire," answered he of Lebret, "men say that
you hold in prison a knight whose name I well know,
whom you dare not deliver."</p>

<p>"That is true," broke in Oliver de Clisson; "I
have heard the same said."</p>

<p>The prince heard them with a countenance that
reddened with anger.</p>

<p>"I know no knight in the world," he declared,
"who, if he were my prisoner, I would not put to a
fair ransom, according to his ability."</p>

<p>"How, then, do you forget Bertrand du Guesclin?"
said Lebret.</p>

<p>The prince doubly changed color on hearing this.
He felt himself fairly caught, and, after a minute's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
indecision, he gave orders that Bertrand should be
brought before him.</p>

<p>The knights who went in search found Bertrand
talking with his chamberlain, as a relief to his
weariness.</p>

<p>"You are come in good time," he said to his
visitors, and bade the chamberlain bring wine.</p>

<p>"It is fitting that we should have good and strong
wine," said one of the knights, "for we bring you
good and pleasant tidings, with the best of good-will."</p>

<p>"The prince has sent us for you," said another.
"We think you will be ransomed by the help of the
many friends you have in court."</p>

<p>"What say you?" answered Bertrand. "I have
not a half-penny to my purse, and owe more than
ten thousand livres in this city, which have been
lent me since I have been held prisoner here. I
cannot well ask more from my friends."</p>

<p>"How have you got rid of so much?" asked one
of his visitors.</p>

<p>"I can easily answer for that," said Bertrand,
with a laugh. "I have eaten, drunk, given, and
played at dice. A little money is soon spent. But
that matters not; if once free I shall soon pay it.
He who, for my help, lends me the keys of his
money, has it in the best of keeping."</p>

<p>"Sir, you are stout-hearted," answered an officer.
"It seems to you that everything which you would
have must happen."</p>

<p>"By my faith, you are right," said Bertrand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
heartily. "In my view a dispirited man is a beaten
and discomfited one."</p>

<p>"Surely there is enchantment in your blood,"
rejoined the officer, "for you seem proof against
every shock."</p>

<p>Leaving Bertrand's chamber, they sought that in
which was the prince and his companions. The
prisoner was dressed in a rough gray coat, and bore
himself with manly ease and assurance. The prince
laughed pleasantly on seeing him.</p>

<p>"Well, Bertrand, how are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sir, when it shall please you, I may fare better,"
answered Bertrand, bowing slightly. "Many
a day have I heard the rats and mice, but it is long
since I have heard the song of birds. I shall hear
them when it is your pleasure."</p>

<p>"That shall be when you will, Bertrand," said the
prince. "I require you only to swear never to bear
arms against me nor these with me, nor to assist
Henry of Spain. If you consent to this, we shall
set you free, pay your debts, and give ten thousand
florins to equip you anew. If you refuse, you shall
not go."</p>

<p>"Then, sir," answered Bertrand, proudly, "my
deliverance will not come to pass, for before I do this,
may I lie chained by the leg in prison while I live.
With God's will, I shall never be a reproach to my
friends, but shall serve with my whole heart the
good king of France, and the noble dukes of Anjou,
Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, whose subject I
have been. But, so please you, worthy prince, suffer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
me to go. You have held me too long in prison,
wrongfully and without cause. Had I been free
I had intended to go from France, to work out my
salvation by fighting the Saracens."</p>

<p>"Why, then, went you not straight, without
stopping?" asked the prince.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," exclaimed Bertrand, in a loud
and fierce tone. "We found Peter,&mdash;the curse of
God confound him!&mdash;who had long since thrice
falsely murdered his noble queen, who was of the
royal blood of France and your own cousin. I
stopped to take revenge for her, and to help Henry,
whom I believe to be the rightful king of Spain.
But you, through pride and covetousness of gold
and silver, came to Spain, thinking to have the
throne after the death of Peter. In this you injured
your own blood and troubled me and my
people, ruined your friends and famished your
army, and for what? After all this, Peter has
deceived you by cheating and trickery, for he
has not kept faith nor covenant with you. But
for this, by my soul and faith, I thank him
heartily."</p>

<p>These bold words were listened to by the prince
with a changeful face. Seldom had he heard the
truth spoken so bluntly, or with such firm composure
in the speaker. When he had ceased, the
prince rose, and with a somewhat bitter laugh
declared that, on his soul, Bertrand had spoken but
the truth. The barons around repeated the same
among themselves, and, fixing their eyes on Bertrand,
said,&mdash;"A brave fellow, the Breton."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whether this be truth or no, Bertrand," continued
the prince, "you have rejected my offer, and
shall not escape without a good ransom. It vexes
me to let you go at all, for your king has none like
you; but as men say that I keep you prisoner because
I fear you, you shall go free on payment of
sufficient ransom. Men shall learn that I neither
fear nor care for you."</p>

<p>"Sir, I thank you," said Bertrand. "But I am
a poor knight of little name and small means.
What estate I have is deeply mortgaged for the
purchase of war-horses, and I owe besides in this
town full ten thousand florins. I pray you, therefore,
to be moderate, and deliver me."</p>

<p>"Where will you go, fair sir?" asked the prince.</p>

<p>"Where I may regain my loss," answered Bertrand.
"More than that, I say not."</p>

<p>"Consider, then," said the prince, "what ransom
you will give me. What sum you name shall be
enough for me."</p>

<p>"I trust you will not stoop to retract your meaning,"
rejoined Bertrand. "And since you are content
to refer it to my pleasure, I ought not to value
myself too low. So I will give and engage for my
freedom one hundred thousand double golden
florins."</p>

<p>These words roused the greatest surprise and
excitement in the room. Many of those present
started, and the prince changed color, as he looked
around at his knights.</p>

<p>"Does he mean to make game of me, that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
offers such a sum?" asked the prince. "I would
gladly free him for the quarter."</p>

<p>Then, turning again to Bertrand, who stood with
impassive countenance, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bertrand, neither can you pay, nor do I wish
such a sum. So consider again."</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Bertrand, with grave composure,
"since you wish not so much, I place myself at
sixty thousand double florins; you shall not have
less, if you but discharge me."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said the prince. "I agree to it."</p>

<p>Then Bertrand looked round him with glad eyes,
and drew up his form with proud assurance.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "Prince Henry may truly vaunt
that he will die king of Spain, cost him what it
may, if he but lend me half my ransom, and the
king of France the other. If I can neither go nor
send to these two, I will get all the spinstresses in
France to spin it, rather than that I should remain
longer in your hands."</p>

<p>"What sort of man is this?" said the prince,
aside to his lords. "He is startled by nothing,
either in act or thought; no more than if he had all
the gold in the world. He has set himself at sixty
thousand double florins, when I would have willingly
accepted ten thousand."</p>

<p>The barons talked among one another, lost in
astonishment. Bertrand stood aside, his eyes fixed
quietly upon the prince.</p>

<p>"Am I then at liberty?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Whence shall the money come?" queried
Chandos.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
</p>
<p>"Trust me to find it," said Bertrand. "I have
good friends."</p>

<p>"By my faith," answered Chandos, heartily,
"you have one of them here. If you need my help,
thus much I say: I will lend you ten thousand."</p>

<p>"You have my thanks," answered Bertrand.
"But before accepting your offer, I will try the
people of my own country."</p>

<p>The confidence of the gallant soldier was not misplaced.
Part of the sum was raised among his
Breton friends, and King Charles V. of France lent
him thirty thousand Spanish doubloons. In the
beginning of 1368 the Prince of Wales set him at
liberty.</p>

<p>The remaining story of the life of Du Guesclin
is a stirring and interesting one. War was the only
trade he knew, and he plunged boldly into it. First
he joined the Duke of Anjou, who was warring in
Provence against Queen Joan of Naples. Then he
put his sword again at the service of Henry of
Transtamare, who was at war once more with Pedro
the Cruel, and whom he was soon to dethrone and
slay with his own hand. But shortly afterwards
war broke out again between France and England,
and Charles V. summoned Du Guesclin to Paris.</p>

<p>The king's purpose was to do the greatest honor
to the poor but proud soldier. He offered him the
high office of Constable of France,&mdash;commander-in-chief
of the army and the first dignitary under the
crown. Du Guesclin prayed earnestly to be excused,
but the king insisted, and he in the end felt obliged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
to yield. The poor Breton had now indeed risen
to high estate. The king set him beside himself at
table, showed him the deepest affection, and showered
on him gifts and estates. His new wealth the
free-handed soldier dispensed lavishly, giving
numerous and sumptuous dinners, where, says his
poet chronicler,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-4">"At Bertrand's plate gazed every eye,<br /></span>
<span>So massive, chased so gloriously."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>This plate proved a slippery possession. More than
once he pledged it, and in the end sold great part of
it, to pay "without fail the knights and honorable
fighting-men of whom he was the leader."</p>

<p>The war roused a strong spirit of nationality
through France. Towns, strongholds, and castles
were everywhere occupied and fortified. The English
marched through the country, but found no
army in the field, no stronghold that was to be had
without a hard siege. Du Guesclin adopted the
waiting policy, and kept to it firmly against all
opposition of lord or prince. It was his purpose
to let the English scatter and waste themselves in
a host of small operations and petty skirmishes.
For eight years the war continued, with much suffering
to France, with no gain to England. In 1373
an English army landed at Calais, which overran
nearly the whole of France without meeting a
French army or mastering a French fortress, while
incessantly harassed by detached parties of soldiers.
On returning, of the thirty thousand horses with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
which they had landed, "they could not muster
more than six thousand at Bordeaux, and had lost
full a third of their men and more. There were
seen noble knights who had great possessions in
their own country, toiling along afoot, without
armor, and begging their bread from door to door
without getting any." Such were the happy results
for France of the Fabian policy of the Constable
Du Guesclin.</p>

<p>A truce was at length signed, that both parties
might have time to breathe. Soon afterwards, on
June 8, 1376, the Black Prince died, and in June of
the following year his father, Edward III., followed
him to the tomb, and France was freed from
its greatest foes. During his service as constable,
Bertrand had recovered from English hands the
provinces of Poitou, Guienne, and Auvergne, and
thus done much towards the establishment of a
united France.</p>

<p>Du Guesclin was not long to survive his great
English enemies. The king treated him unjustly,
and he threw up his office of constable, declaring
that he would seek Spain and enter the service of
Henry of Castile. This threat brought the king to
his senses. He sent the Dukes of Anjou and Bourbon
to beg Du Guesclin to retain his office. The
indignant soldier yielded to their persuasions,
accepted again the title of Constable of France, and
died four days afterwards, on July 13, 1380. He
had been sent into Languedoc to suppress disturbances
and brigandage, provoked by the harsh government
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of the Duke of Anjou, and in this service
fell sick while besieging Ch&acirc;teauneuf-Randon, in the
G&eacute;vandan, a fortress then held by the English.
He died at sixty-six years of age, with his last
words exhorting the captains around him "never
to forget that, in whatsoever country they might
be making war, churchmen, women, children, and
the poor people were not their enemies."</p>

<p>He won victory even after his death, so say the
chronicles of that day. It is related that an agreement
had been made for the surrender of the besieged
fortress, and that the date fixed was July 14,
the day after Du Guesclin died. The new commander
of the army summoned the governor to
surrender, but he declared that he had given his
word to Du Guesclin, and would yield the place to
no other. He was told that the constable was dead.</p>

<p>"Very well;" he replied, "I will carry the keys
of the town to his tomb."</p>

<p>And so he did. He marched out of the place at
the head of his garrison, passed through the lines
of the besieging army, knelt before Du Guesclin's
corpse, and laid the keys of Ch&acirc;teauneuf-Randon
on his bier.</p>

<p>And thus passed away one of the greatest and
noblest warriors France had ever known, honored
in life and triumphant in death.

<a name="h2-11" id="h2-11"></a><h2><i>JOAN OF ARC,
THE MAID OF ORLEANS.</i></h2>


<p>At the hour of noon, on a sunny summer's day
in the year of our Lord 1425, a young girl of the
little village of Domremy, France, stood with bent
head and thoughtful eyes in the small garden
attached to her father's humble home. There was
nothing in her appearance to attract a second
glance. Her parents were peasants, her occupation
was one of constant toil, her attire was of the humblest,
her life had been hitherto spent in aiding
her mother at home or in driving her father's few
sheep afield. None who saw her on that day could
have dreamed that this simple peasant maiden was
destined to become one of the most famous women
whose name history records, and that this day, was
that of the beginning of her career.</p>

<p>She had been born at a critical period in history.
Her country was in extremity. For the greater
part of a century the dreadful "Hundred Years'
War" had been waged, desolating France, destroying
its people by the thousands, bringing it more
and more under the dominion of a foreign foe.
The realm of France had now reached its lowest
depth of disaster, its king uncrowned, its fairest
regions overrun,&mdash;here by the English, there by
the Burgundians,&mdash;the whole kingdom in peril of
being taken and reduced to vassalage. Never before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
nor since had the need of a deliverer been so
vitally felt. The deliverer chosen of heaven was
the young peasant girl who walked that summer
noon in her father's humble garden at Domremy.</p>

<p>Young as she was, she had seen the horrors of
war. Four years before the village had been plundered
and burnt, its defenders slain or wounded,
the surrounding country devastated. The story of
the suffering and peril of France was in all French
ears. Doubtless little Joan's soul burned with
sympathy for her beloved land as she moved
thoughtfully up and down the garden paths, asking
herself if God could longer permit such wrongs
and disasters to continue.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to her right, in the direction of the
small village church, Joan heard a voice calling
her, and, looking thither, she was surprised and
frightened at seeing a great light. The voice, continued;
her courage returned; "it was a worthy
voice," she tells us, one that could come only from
angels. "I saw them with my bodily eyes," she
afterwards said. "When they departed from me I
wept and would fain have had them take me with
them." Again and again came to her the voices
and the forms; they haunted her; and still the
burden of their exhortation was the same, that she
should "go to France to deliver the kingdom."
The girl grew dreamy. She became lost in meditation,
full of deep thoughts and budding purposes,
wrought by the celestial voices into high hopes and
noble aspirations, possessed with the belief that she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
had been chosen by heaven to deliver France from
its woes and to disconcert its enemies.</p>

<p>The times were fitting for such a conception.
Two forces ruled mens' minds,&mdash;ambition and trust
in the supernatural. The powerful depended upon
their own arms for aid; the weak and miserable
turned to Christ and the Virgin for support; there
were those who looked to see God in bodily person;
His angels and ministers were thought to deal
directly with man; it was an age in which force
and fraud alike were dominant, in which men were
governed in their bodies by the sword, in their souls
by their belief in and dread of the supernatural, and
in which enthusiasm had higher sway than thought.
It was enthusiastic belief in her divine mission that
moved Joan of Arc. It was trust in her as God's
agent of deliverance that filled the soul of France
with new spirit, and unnerved her foes with enfeebling
fears. Joan's mission and her age were
well associated. In the nineteenth century she
would have been covered with ridicule; in the fifteenth
she led France to victory.</p>

<p>Three years passed away. Joan's faith in her
mission had grown with the years. Some ridiculed,
many believed her. The story of her angelic voices
was spreading. At length came the event that
moved her to action. The English laid siege to
Orleans, the most important city in the kingdom
after Paris and Rouen. If this were lost, all might
be lost. Some of the bravest warriors of France
fought in its defence; but the garrison was weak,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the English were strong, their works surrounded the
walls; daily the city was more closely pressed;
unless relieved it must fall.</p>

<p>"I must go to raise the siege of Orleans," said
Joan to Robert de Baudricourt, commander of Vaucouleurs,
with whom she had gained speech. "I
will go, should I have to wear off my legs to the
knee."</p>

<p>"I must be with the king before the middle of
Lent," she said later to John of Metz, a knight
serving with Baudricourt; "for none in the world,
nor kings, nor dukes, nor daughter of the Scottish
king can recover the kingdom of France; there is
no help but in me. Assuredly I would far rather
be spinning beside my poor mother, for this other
is not my condition; but I must go and do my work
because my Lord wills that I should do it."</p>

<p>"Who is your Lord?" asked John of Metz.</p>

<p>"The Lord God."</p>

<p>"By my faith," cried the knight, as he seized
her hands. "I will take you to the king, God
helping. When will you set out?"</p>

<p>"Rather now than to-morrow; rather to-morrow
than later," said Joan.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March, 1429, the devoted girl
arrived at Chinon, in Touraine, where the king
then was. She had journeyed nearly a hundred
and fifty leagues, through a country that was everywhere
a theatre of war, without harm or insult.
She was dressed in a coat of mail, bore lance and
sword, and had a king's messenger and an archer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
as her train. This had been deemed necessary to
her safety in those distracted times.</p>

<p>Interest and curiosity went before her. Baudricourt's
letters to the king had prepared him for
something remarkable. Certain incidents which
happened during Joan's journey, and which were
magnified by report into miracles, added to the feeling
in her favor. The king and his council doubted
if it were wise to give her an audience. That a
peasant girl could succor a kingdom in extremity
seemed the height of absurdity. But something
must be done. Orleans was in imminent danger.
If it were taken, the king might have to fly to
Spain or Scotland. He had no money. His treasury,
it is said, held only four crowns. He had no
troops to send to the besieged city. Drowning men
catch at straws. The people of Orleans had heard
of Joan and clamored for her; with her, they felt
sure, would come superhuman aid. The king consented
to receive her.</p>

<p>It was the 9th of March, 1429. The hour was
evening. Candles dimly lighted the great hall of
the king's palace at Chinon, in which nearly three
hundred knights were gathered. Charles VII., the
king, was among them, distinguished by no mark or
sign, more plainly dressed than most of those around
him, standing retired in the throng.</p>

<p>Joan was introduced. The story&mdash;in which we
cannot put too much faith&mdash;says that she walked
straight to the king through the crowd of showily-dressed
lords and knights, though she had never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
seen him before, and said, in quiet and humble
tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentle dauphin" (she did not think it right to
call him king until he had been crowned), "my
name is Joan the maid; the King of Heaven sendeth
you word by me that you shall be anointed and
crowned in the city of Rheims, and shall be lieutenant
of the King of Heaven, who is king of
France. It is God's pleasure that our enemies, the
English, should depart to their own country; if they
depart not, evil will come to them, and the kingdom
is sure to continue yours."</p>

<p>What followed is shrouded in doubt. Some say
that Joan told Charles things that none but himself
had known. However this be, the king determined
to go to Poitiers and have this seeming messenger
from Heaven questioned strictly as to her mission,
by learned theologians of the University of Paris
there present.</p>

<p>"In the name of God," said Joan, "I know that
I shall have rough work there, but my Lord will
help me. Let us go, then, for God's sake."</p>

<p>They went. It was an august and learned assembly
into which the unlettered girl was introduced,
yet for two hours she answered all their questions
with simple earnestness and shrewd wit.</p>

<p>"In what language do the voices speak to you?"
asked Father Seguin, the Dominican, "a very sour
man," says the chronicle.</p>

<p>"Better than yours," answered Joan. The doctor
spoke a provincial dialect.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you believe in God?" he asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"More than you do," answered Joan, with equal
sharpness.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "God forbids belief in you
without some sign tending thereto; I shall not give
the king advice to trust men-at-arms to you and
put them in peril on your simple word."</p>

<p>"In the name of God," replied Joan, "I am not
come to Poitiers to show signs. Take me to Orleans
and I will give you signs of what I am sent for.
Let me have ever so few men-at-arms given me and
I will go to Orleans."</p>

<p>For a fortnight the questioning was continued.
In the end the doctors pronounced in Joan's favor.
Two of them were convinced of her divine mission.
They declared that she was the virgin foretold in
ancient prophecies, notably in those of Merlin. All
united in saying that "there had been discovered in
her naught but goodness, humility, devotion, honesty,
and simplicity."</p>

<p>Charles decided. The Maid should go to Orleans.
A suit of armor was made to fit her. She was given
the following of a war-chief. She had a white banner
made, which was studded with lilies, and bore
on it a figure of God seated on clouds and bearing
a globe, while below were two kneeling angels, above
were the words "Jesu Maria." Her sword she required
the king to provide. One would be found,
she said, marked with five crosses, behind the altar
in the chapel of St. Catharine de Fierbois, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
she had stopped on her arrival in Chinon. Search
was made, and the sword was found.</p>

<p>And now five weeks were passed in weary preliminaries,
despite the fact that Orleans pleaded
earnestly for succor. Joan had friends at court, but
she had powerful enemies, whose designs her coming
had thwarted, and it was they who secretly opposed
her plans. At length, on the 27th of April, the
march to Orleans began.</p>

<p>On the 29th the army of relief arrived before the
city. There were ten or twelve thousand men in the
train, guarding a heavy convoy of food. The English
covered the approach to the walls, the only
unguarded passage being beyond the Loire, which
ran by the town. To the surprise and vexation of
Joan her escort determined to cross the stream.</p>

<p>"Was it you," she asked Dunois, who had left the
town to meet her, "who gave counsel for making me
come hither by this side of the river, and not the
direct way, over there where Talbot and the English
are?"</p>

<p>"Yes; such was the opinion of the wisest captains,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, the counsel of my Lord is
wiser than yours. You thought to deceive me, and
you have deceived yourselves, for I am bringing
you the best succor that ever had knight, or town, or
city, and that is, the good-will of God and succor
from the King of Heaven; not, assuredly, for love
of me; it is from God only that it proceeds."</p>

<p>She wished to remain with the troops until they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
could enter the city, but Dunois urged her to cross
the stream at once, with such portion of the convoy
as the boats might convey immediately.</p>

<p>"Orleans would count it for naught," he said, "if
they received the victuals without the Maid."</p>

<p>She decided to go, and crossed the stream with
two hundred men-at-arms and part of the supplies.
At eight o'clock that evening she entered the city,
on horseback, in full armor, her banner preceding
her, beside her Dunois, behind her the captains of
the garrison and several of the most distinguished
citizens. The population hailed her coming with
shouts of joy, crowding on the procession, torch in
hand, so closely that her banner was set on fire.
Joan made her horse leap forward with the skill of
a practised horseman, and herself extinguished the
flame.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable change in her life. Three
years before, a simple peasant child, she had been
listening to the "voices" in her father's garden
at Domremy. Now, the associate of princes and
nobles, and the last hope of the kingdom, she was
entering a beleaguered city at the head of an army,
amid the plaudits of the population, and followed by
the prayers of France. She was but seventeen years
old, still a mere girl, yet her coming had filled her
countrymen with hope and depressed their foes with
dread. Such was the power of religious belief in
that good medi&aelig;val age.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Maid was announced to the
besiegers by a herald, who bore a summons from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
her to the English, bidding them to leave the land
and give up the keys of the cities which they had
wrongfully taken, under peril of being visited by
God's judgment. They detained and threatened to
burn the herald, as a warning to Joan, the sorceress,
as they deemed her. Yet such was their terror
that they allowed the armed force still outside the
city to enter unmolested, through their intrenchments.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p125" id="p125"></a>
<img src="images/p125.jpg" alt="JOAN OF ARC AT ORLEANS." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">JOAN OF ARC AT ORLEANS.</span>
</div>

<p>The warning Joan had sent them by herald she
now repeated in person, mounting a bastion and
bidding the English, in a loud voice, to begone, else
woe and shame would come upon them.</p>

<p>The commandant of the bastille opposite, Sir
William Gladesdale, answered with insults, bidding
her to go back and mind her cows, and saying that
the French were miscreants.</p>

<p>"You speak falsely!" cried Joan; "and in spite
of yourselves shall soon depart hence; many of your
people shall be slain; but as for you, you shall not
see it."</p>

<p>Nor did he; he was drowned a few days afterwards,
a shot from Orleans destroying a drawbridge
on which he stood, with many companions.</p>

<p>What succeeded we may tell briefly. Inspired by
the intrepid Maid, the besieged boldly attacked the
British forts, and took them one after another. The
first captured was that of St. Loup, which was carried
by Joan and her troops, despite the brave defence
of the English. The next day, the 6th of
May, other forts were assailed and taken, the men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of Orleans, led by Joan, proving irresistible. The
English would not face her in the open field, and
under her leadership the French intrepidly stormed
their ramparts.</p>

<p>A memorable incident occurred during the assault
on the works south of the city. Here Joan seized a
scaling ladder, and was mounting it herself when an
arrow struck and wounded her. She was taken
aside, her armor removed, and she herself pulled
out the arrow, though with some tears and signs of
faintness. Her wound being dressed, she retired
into a vineyard to rest and pray. Discouraged by
her absence, the French began to give way. The
captains ordered the retreat to be sounded.</p>

<p>"My God, we shall soon be inside," cried Joan to
Dunois. "Give your people a little rest; eat and
drink."</p>

<p>In a short time she resumed her arms, mounted
her horse, ordered her banner to be displayed, and
put herself at the head of the storming party.
New courage inspired the French; the English, who
had seen her fall, and were much encouraged thereby,
beheld her again in arms with superstitious
dread. Joan pressed on; the English retreated;
the fort was taken without another blow. Back to
Orleans marched the triumphant Maid, the people
wild with joy. All through the night the bells
rang out glad peals, and the <i>Te Deum</i> was chanted.
Much reason had they for joy: Orleans was saved.</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday that these events had taken
place. At daybreak of the next day, Sunday, May
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
8, the English advanced to the moats of the city as
if to offer battle. Some of the French leaders
wished to accept their challenge, but Joan ran to
the city gates, and bade them desist "for the love
and honor of holy Sunday."</p>

<p>"It is God's good-will and pleasure," she said,
"that they be allowed to get them gone if they be
minded to go away; if they attack you, defend
yourselves boldly; you will be the masters."</p>

<p>An altar was raised at her suggestion; mass was
celebrated, and hymns of thanksgiving chanted.
While this was being done, the English turned and
marched away, with banners flying. Their advance
had been an act of bravado.</p>

<p>"See," cried Joan, "are the English turning to
you their faces, or verily their backs? Let them
go; my Lord willeth not that there be any fighting
this day; you shall have them another time."</p>

<p>Her words were true; the English were in full
retreat; the siege of Orleans was raised. So hastily
had they gone that they had left their sick and
many of their prisoners behind, while the abandoned
works were found to be filled with provisions and
military supplies. The Maid had fulfilled her mission.
France was saved.</p>

<p>History contains no instance to match this. A
year before, Joan of Arc, a low-born peasant girl,
had occupied herself in tending sheep and spinning
flax; her hours of leisure being given to dreams and
visions. Now, clad in armor and at the head of an
army, she was gazing in triumph on the flight of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
hostile army, driven from its seemingly assured
prey by her courage, intrepidity, and enthusiasm,
while veteran soldiers obeyed her commands, experienced
leaders yielded to her judgment. Never
had the world seen its like. The Maid of Orleans
had made her name immortal.</p>

<p>Three days afterward Joan was with the king, at
Tours. She advanced to meet him with her banner
in her hand, her head uncovered, and making a deep
obeisance over her horse's head. Charles met her
with the deepest joy, taking off his cap and extending
his hand, while his face beamed with warm
gratitude.</p>

<p>She urged him to march at once against his flying
enemies, and to start without delay for Rheims,
there to be crowned, that her mission might be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>"I shall hardly last more than a year," she said,
with prophetic insight; "we must think of working
right well this year, for there is much to do."</p>

<p>Charles hesitated; hesitation was natural to him.
He had many advisers who opposed Joan's counsel.
There were no men, no money, for so great a journey,
they said. Councils were held, but nothing
was decided on. Joan grew impatient and impetuous.
Many supported her. Great lords from all
parts of France promised their aid. One of these,
Guy de Laval, thus pictures the Maid:</p>

<p>"It seems a thing divine to look on her and listen
to her. I saw her mount on horseback, armed all
in white armor, save her head, and with a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
axe in her hand, on a great black charger, which,
at the door of her quarters, was very restive and
would not let out her mount. Then said she, 'Lead
him to the cross,' which was in front of the neighboring
church, on the road. There she mounted
him without his moving, and as if he were tied
up; and turning towards the door of the church,
which was very nigh at hand, she said, in quite a
womanly voice, 'You priests and churchmen, make
procession and prayers to God!' Then she resumed
her road, saying, 'Push forward, push forward!'"</p>

<p>Push forward it was. The army was infected
with her enthusiasm, irresistible with belief in her.
On the 10th of June she led them to the siege of
the fortified places which lay around Orleans. One
by one they fell. On Sunday, June 12, Jargeau
was taken. Beaugency next fell. Nothing could
withstand the impetuosity of the Maid and her followers,
Patay was assailed.</p>

<p>"Have you good spurs?" she asked her captains.</p>

<p>"Ha! must we fly, then!" they demanded.</p>

<p>"No, surely; but there will be need to ride
boldly; we shall give a good account of the English,
and our spurs will serve us famously in pursuing
them."</p>

<p>The French attacked, by order of Joan.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, we must fight," she said.
"Though the English were suspended from the
clouds, we should have them, for God has sent us to
punish them. The gentle king shall have to-day the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
greatest victory he has ever had; my counsel has
told me that they are ours."</p>

<p>Her voices counselled well. The battle was short,
the victory decisive. The English were put to
flight; Lord Talbot, their leader, was taken.</p>

<p>"Lord Talbot, this is not what you expected this
morning," said the Duke d'Alen&ccedil;on.</p>

<p>"It is the fortune of war," answered Talbot,
coolly.</p>

<p>Joan returned to the king and demanded that
they should march instantly for Rheims. He hesitated
still. His counsellors advised delay. The
impatient Maid left the court and sought the army.
She was mistress of the situation. The king and
his court were obliged to follow her. On June 29
the army, about twelve thousand strong, began the
march to Rheims.</p>

<p>There were obstacles on the road, but all gave
way before her. The strong town of Troyes, garrisoned
by English and Burgundians, made a show
of resistance; but when her banner was displayed,
and the assault began, she being at the head of the
troops, the garrison lost heart and surrendered.
On went the army, all opposition vanishing. On
the 16th of July, King Charles entered Rheims.
The coronation was fixed for the following day.
"Make good use of my time," Joan repeated to the
king, "for I shall hardly last longer than a year."</p>

<p>In less than three months she had driven the
English from before Orleans, captured from them
city after city, raised the sinking cause of France
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
into a hopeful state, and now had brought the prince
to be crowned in that august cathedral which had
witnessed the coronation of so many kings. On the
17th the ceremony took place with much grandeur
and solemnity. Joan rode between Dunois and the
Archbishop of Rheims, while the air rang with the
acclamations of the immense throng.</p>

<p>"I have accomplished that which my Lord commanded
me to do," said Joan, "to raise the siege of
Orleans and have the gentle king crowned. I
should like it well if it should please Him to send
me back to my father and mother, to keep their
sheep and their cattle and do that which was my
wont."</p>

<p>It would have been well for her if she had done
so, for her future career was one of failure and
misfortune. She kept in arms at the king's desire.
In September she attacked Paris, and was defeated,
she herself being pierced through the thigh with an
arrow. It was her first repulse. During the winter
we hear little of her. Her family was ennobled by
royal decree, and the district of Domremy made
free from all tax or tribute. In the spring the
enemy attacked Compi&egrave;gne. Joan threw herself
into the town to save it. She had not been there
many hours when, in a sortie, the French were
repulsed. Joan and some of her followers remained
outside fighting, while the drawbridge was raised
and the portcullis dropped by the frightened commandant.
The Burgundians crowded around her.
Twenty of them surrounded her horse. One, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Picard archer, "a tough fellow and mighty sour,"
seized her and flung her to the ground. She was a
prisoner in their hands.</p>

<p>The remaining history of Joan of Arc presents a
striking picture of the character of the age. It is
beyond our purpose to give it. It will suffice to say
that she was tried by the English as a sorceress,
dealt with unfairly in every particular, and in the
end, on May 30, 1431, was burned at the stake.
Even as the flames rose she affirmed that the voices
which she had obeyed came from God. Her voice
was raised in prayer as death approached, the last
word heard from her lips being "Jesus!"</p>

<p>"Would that my soul were where I believe the
soul of that woman is!" cried two of her judges, on
seeing her die.</p>

<p>And Tressart, secretary to Henry VI. of England,
said, on his return from the place of execution,
"We are all lost; we have burned a saint!"</p>

<p>A saint she was, an inspired one. She died, but
France was saved.

<a name="h2-12" id="h2-12"></a><h2><i>THE CAREER
OF A KNIGHT-ERRANT.</i></h2>


<p>Medi&aelig;val history would be of greatly reduced
interest but for its sprightly stories of knights and
their doings. In those days when men, "clad in
complete steel," did their fighting with spear, sword,
and battle-axe, and were so enamoured of hard
blows and blood-letting that in the intervals of war
they spent their time seeking combat and adventure,
much more of the startling and romantic naturally
came to pass than can be looked for in these
days of the tyranny of commerce and the dominion
of "villanous saltpetre." This was the more so
from the fact that enchanters, magicians, demons,
dragons, and all that uncanny brood, the creation
of ignorance and fancy, made knighthood often no
sinecure, and men's haunting belief in the supernatural
were frequently more troublesome to them
than their armed enemies. But with this misbegotten
crew we have nothing to do. They belong
to legend and fiction, not to history, and it is with
the latter alone that we are here concerned. But as
more than one example has been given of how
knights bore themselves in battle, it behooves us
to tell something of the doings of a knight-errant,
one of those worthy fellows who went abroad to
prove their prowess in single combat, and win glory
in the tournament at spear's point.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p133" id="p133"></a>
<img src="images/p133.jpg" alt="A DUEL OF KNIGHTS." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">A DUEL OF KNIGHTS.</span>
</div>

<p>Such a knight was Jacques de Lelaing, "the good
knight without fear and without doubt," as his
chroniclers entitle him, a Burgundian by birth, born
in the ch&acirc;teau of Lelaing early in the fifteenth
century. Jacques was well brought up for a knight.
Literature was cultivated in Burgundy in those
days, and the boy was taught the arts of reading and
writing, the accomplishments of French and Latin,
and in his later life he employed the pen as well as
the sword, and did literary work of which specimens
still survive.</p>

<p>In warlike sports he excelled. He was still but
a youth when the nephew of Philip the Good of
Burgundy (Philip the <i>Bad</i> would have hit the mark
more nearly) carried him off to his uncle's court to
graduate in knighthood. The young adventurer
sought the court of Philip well equipped for his
new duties, his father, William de Lelaing, having
furnished him with four fine horses, a skilful groom,
and a no less skilful valet; and also with some good
advice, to the effect that, "Inasmuch as you are
more noble than others by birth, so should you be
more noble than they by virtues," adding that, "few
great men have gained renown for prowess and
virtue who did not entertain love for some dame or
damoiselle."</p>

<p>The latter part of the advice the youthful squire
seemed well inclined to accept. He was handsome,
gallant, bold, and eloquent, and quickly became a
favorite with the fair sex. Nor was he long in
gaining an opportunity to try his hand in battle, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
squabble having arisen between Philip and a neighboring
prince. This at an end, our hero, stirred by
his "errant disposition," left Philip's court, eager,
doubtless, to win his spurs by dint of battle-axe
and blows of blade.</p>

<p>In 1445 he appeared at Nancy, then occupied by
the French court, which had escorted thither Margaret
of Anjou, who was to be taken to England as
bride to Henry VI. The occasion was celebrated
by festivals, of which a tournament was the principal
feature, and here the Burgundian squire, piqued
at some disparaging remarks of the French knights,
rode into the lists and declared his purpose to hold
them against all comers, challenging the best knight
there to unhorse him if he could.</p>

<p>The boastful squire was richly adorned for the
occasion, having already made friends among the
ladies of the court, and wearing favors and jewels
received at the hands of some of the fairest there.
Nor was his boast an empty one. Not a man who
faced him was able to hurl him from the saddle,
while many of them left the lists with bruised bodies
or broken bones.</p>

<p>"What manner of man will this be," said the
onlookers, "who as a boy is so firm of seat and
strong of hand?"</p>

<p>At the banquet which followed Jacques was as
fresh and gay as if newly risen from sleep, and his
conquests among the ladies were as many as he had
won among the knights. That night he went to his
couch the owner of a valuable diamond given him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
by the Duchess of Orleans, and of a ring set with a
precious ruby, the gift of the Duchess of Calabria.
Verily, the squire of Burgundy had made his mark.</p>

<p>The end of the year found our bold squire in Antwerp.
Here, in the cathedral of Notre Dame, he
met an arrogant Sicilian knight named Bonifazio,
whose insolent bearing annoyed him. The Sicilian
wore on his left leg a golden fetter-ring fastened by
a chain of gold to a circlet above his knee, while
his shield bore the defiant motto, "Who has fair
lady, let him look to her well."</p>

<p>Jacques looked at the swaggering fellow, liked
his bearing but little, and touched his shield by way
of challenge, saying, "Thine is an impertinent
device."</p>

<p>"And thou art but a sorry squire, though with
assurance enough for a tried knight," answered the
Sicilian.</p>

<p>"That is to prove," said Jacques, defiantly. "If
my master, Duke Philip, will give me leave to fight,
thou durst not deny me, being, as we are, on his
Grace's territory."</p>

<p>Bonifazio accepted the challenge, and as the duke
gave consent, a battle between squire and knight
was arranged, Ghent being the chosen place of
combat.</p>

<p>Two days it lasted, the first day's fight being a
sort of horseback prelude to the main combat. In
this the squire bore himself so well against his
experienced antagonist, that Duke Philip judged
he had fairly won his spurs, and on the next day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
he was formally made a knight, with the accolade
and its attendant ceremonies.</p>

<p>This day the work displayed worthily followed the
promising preface. After a preliminary bout with
spears, the combatants seized their battle-axes, and
hewed at each other with the vigor of two woodmen
felling a mighty oak. The edges of the axes being
spoiled, the knights drew their well-tempered swords
and renewed the combat with the lustihood of the
heroes of the Round Table, fighting so fiercely that
it was not easy to follow the gleam of the swift-flashing
blades. In the end the Burgundian proved
himself more than a match for the Sicilian, driving
him back, hewing rents in his armor, and threatening
him with speedy death. At this stage of the
affray Duke Philip, at the request of the Duke of
Orleans, flung his truncheon into the lists and ended
the fight, in time to save the Sicilian knight.</p>

<p>His signal victory won Sir Jacques much fame.
His antagonist was a man of mark, and the Burgundian
knight gained from his prowess the appellation
of "The Good Knight," which he maintained
throughout his career. He now determined to take
up the profession of knight-errant, travelling from
court to court, and winning smiles and fame wherever
lists were set up or men of prowess could be
found. But first he sought his home and the
approval of his parents.</p>

<p>"Go on thy way, with God's blessing," said his
stout sire, who had cracked skulls in his day and
was proud of his doughty son.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
</p>
<p>"Yes, go on thy way, Jacques," said his mother
in milder tone, and with moist eyes. "I have put
a healing ointment in thy valise, that will cure
bruises. If thou shouldst break a bone, Heaven
send thee a skilful surgeon."</p>

<p>Into France rode Sir Jacques, well mounted, and
with squire and page in his train, in search of
adventures and opponents, eager for fame and profit.
From his left arm, fastened by a chain of gold, hung
a splendid helmet, which he offered as a prize to
any knight who could overcome him in single combat.
To this he added a diamond, which he agreed
to present to any lady whom his victor should name.
Whoever should first drop his axe in the combat
was to bestow a bracelet on his opponent. To this
Jacques added a singular stipulation, significant
of queer doings in those days, that neither knight
should be fastened to his saddle. For all else, he
put his trust in God and his own right arm, and
in the aid that came to him from the love of "the
fair lady who had more power over him than aught
besides throughout the entire world."</p>

<p>Thus prepared and thus defying, Sir Jacques
rode through Paris and the other cities of France
without meeting a knight ready to accept his challenge.
This was due to the king, however, rather
than to his knights; Charles VII. had forbidden
any of his chevaliers to fight the bold Burgundian,
the fame of whose strength and prowess was already
wide-spread. Through southern France, then in
the hands of the English, rode our hero, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
same fortune. Many were ready to meet him at
the board, none in the field. Into Spain he passed
on, still without an adversary, and sore in temper
despite his pride in his reputation.</p>

<p>At last, in the realm of the Dons, he found a
knight ready to break lances with him in the field,
out of pure duty to his "much loved lady," as he
affirmed. This was Don Diego de Guzman, grand
master of Calatrava, whom he met on the borders
of Castile, and who at once accepted his challenge.
Yet single combat in those days was not quite the
easy affair we might imagine it, if we judged from
fiction and legend. Before a knight could indulge
in mortal affray he was obliged to obtain the consent
of his sovereign, provided that peace ruled between
his country and that of his antagonist, as was the
case between Spain and Burgundy. The king of
Spain was absent. An answer could not be had
immediately. While awaiting it, Sir Jacques rode
into Portugal, followed by a splendid retinue, and
offered an open challenge to the knights of that
kingdom to take the field against him.</p>

<p>His ride was almost a royal procession. The
story of his one combat seemed to have gained
Jacques world-wide fame. From the frontier to
Lisbon he was met with a continuous ovation, and
in the capital, where a ball was given in his honor,
he was invited to open the dance with the queen
for partner. And so it went,&mdash;an abundance of
merry-making, unlimited feasting and dancing, but
no fighting. Sir Jacques grew melancholy. He
pleaded with King Alphonso.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have had a turn in the dance with your
queen," he said; "now let me have a tourney
with your knights."</p>

<p>"Burgundy is my good friend," answered the
king, "and Heaven forbid that a knight from that
court should be roughly treated by any knights of
mine."</p>

<p>"By all the saints, I defy the best of them!"
cried the irate knight.</p>

<p>"And so let it rest," said Alphonso, placably.
"Ride back to Castile, and do thy worst upon Guzman's
hard head and strong ribs."</p>

<p>There being nothing better to do, Jacques complied,
and made his way to Valladolid, having
learned that the king of Spain had graciously consented
to the combat. The 3d of February, 1447,
was the day which had been fixed for the battle
between the two knights, "for the grace of God and
the love of their ladies," and on the advent of that
day the city named was so crowded with sport-loving
Spaniards that its streets were barely passable. A
great day in the history of knight-errantry was
promised, and gentles and simples, lords and ladies
alike, were anxious to see the spectacle.</p>

<p>When the morning of the eventful day dawned
all was bustle and excitement in Valladolid, and
multitudes gathered at the lists. The Burgundian
was on the ground and ready by ten o'clock, but it
was three before Don Guzman appeared, and then
he came armed with an axe so portentously long
in the handle that the Spanish umpires themselves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
anxious as they were for his success, forbade its
use. Yet the truculent Don gave them no small
trouble before he would consent to choose another.
This done, the knights were conducted to their
tents, which they were not to leave till the clarions
had thrice sounded the signal of battle.</p>

<p>Don Guzman, however, proved inconveniently
brave and eager. At the first trumpet blast out he
sprang, and muttered fiercely when ordered back.
The second blast brought him out again, and this
time the king himself sent him back "with an ugly
word." The third blast sounded. Out now flew
both combatants. Battle-axe in hand, they made at
each other, and soon the ring of axe on helmet delighted
the ardent souls of the thousands of lookers-on.
At length, Diego's axe was hurled from his
hand. Jacques, with knightly courtesy, threw down
his, and an interval of wrestling for the mastery
followed. Then they drew their swords, and assailed
each other with undiminished fierceness. What
might have been the result it is not easy to say;
Sir Jacques had no carpet knight to deal with in
Don Diego; but the king ended the business by
throwing his truncheon into the lists, and refusing
permission to the combatants to finish their fight
on horseback, as they wished. They thereupon
shook hands, while the air rang with the shouts of
the spectators.</p>

<p>In the end Don Guzman behaved well. He
praised the skill and courage of his antagonist, and
presented him with an Andalusian horse, covered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with rich trappings. In this Jacques was not to
be outdone. He sent the Don a charger of great
beauty and value, whose coverings were of blue
velvet embroidered in gold, and the saddle of violet
velvet. Banquets and balls followed the combat;
the combatants were feasted to their hearts' content;
and Sir Jacques at length left the court of Spain
loaded with presents and covered with honor.</p>

<p>And now the "good knight" turned his steps
homeward, challenging all champions as he went,
but without finding an opponent. Feasting he
found in abundance; but no fighting. Stopping at
Montpelier, he became the guest of Jacques C&oelig;ur,
silversmith and banker to Charles VII. His worthy
host offered him money freely, and engaged to redeem
any valuables which the wandering knight
might have found it necessary to pawn. Sir
Jacques thanked him, but said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My good master, the Duke of Burgundy, provides
all that is necessary for me, and allows me
to want for nothing."</p>

<p>Soon after, our errant knight reached Philip's
court, where he was received with the highest
honors. Then to his paternal castle he wended his
way, to be welcomed by his proud parents as gladly
as if he had won the Holy Grail. Dancing and
rejoicing followed, in which all the neighboring
noble families participated, and many a fair damsel
shed her smiles&mdash;in vain it seems&mdash;on the famous
and heart-whole knight.</p>

<p>We next hear of Jacques de Lelaing in 1449. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
that year the herald Charolais made his advent at
the Scottish court, bearing a challenge from the
Burgundian knight to the whole clan of the Douglases.
James Douglas accepted the challenge, and
Sir Jacques appeared in due time at Stirling, where
a battle took place in which the Burgundian again
came off victor. From Scotland Jacques sought
England but failed to find in that kingdom any
knight willing to accept his challenge. Yet he had
but fairly got home again when an English knight,
Sir Thomas Karr by name, appeared at the court of
Philip the Good, and challenged Jacques de Lelaing
to combat for the honor of old England.</p>

<p>As may well be imagined, this challenge was
speedily accepted, the lists being set in a field near
Bruges. The English knight was the heavier, but
Jacques was the favorite, for once again he was
fighting on his native soil. Fierce was the combat.
It ended in the Burgundian's favor. Karr struck
him a blow on the arm with his battle-axe which
rendered that arm useless, it being paralyzed or
broken. But the valiant Jacques dropped his axe,
closed with his foe, and with the aid of his one arm
flung him to the ground, falling upon him. This
ended the combat, the Burgundian being pronounced
victor. But as he had been the first to
drop his battle-axe, he presented Sir Thomas with
a rich diamond, as he had agreed in his challenge.</p>

<p>Jacques had been sorely hurt. His wound took
a long time to heal. When his arm had grown
strong again he repaired to Ch&acirc;lons, where he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
opened a tournament of his own, in which he held
the lists against all comers. This was in fulfilment
of a vow which he had made that he would appear
in the closed lists thirty times before the completion
of his thirtieth year. Much fighting was done,
much blood spilt, and much honor gained by Sir
Jacques. We cannot tell all that took place, but
the noble tournament at Ch&acirc;lons was long afterwards
the talk of the country-side.</p>

<p>As for Sir Jacques, he was now at the height of
fame, and Philip the Good, to do him the highest
honor in his power, created him a knight of the
illustrious order of the Golden Fleece. Of his
single combats afterwards we shall but speak of one
fought at Brussels, in honor of the son of the Duke
of Burgundy, then eighteen years old. Jacques de
Lelaing was selected to tilt with the young count,&mdash;doubtless
with the idea that he could be trusted
not to harm him. In the first course that was run
the count shattered his spear against the shield of
Jacques, who raised his own weapon and passed
without touching his adversary. This complaisance
displeased the duke, who sent word to the knight
that if he proposed to play with his adversary he
had better withdraw at once. They ran again.
This time both splintered their spears, and both
kept their seats, much to the delight of Duke Philip.</p>

<p>On the next day the grand tourney came off. To
behold it there were present no less than two hundred
and twenty-five princes, barons, knights, and
squires. That day the youthful Count de Charolais
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
acquitted himself nobly, breaking eighteen spears,&mdash;and
possibly some bones of his antagonists. He
carried off the prize, which was bestowed upon him
by the ladies of his father's court, and Duke Philip
gloried in the prowess of his son.</p>

<p>With that tournament ended the record of the
single combats of Jacques de Lelaing. War followed,
the duke and his robber barons fighting
against the rich cities of Belgium, and spoiling many
of them. In those wars Sir Jacques took part.
At length, in June, 1453, siege was being made
against the Ch&acirc;teau de Pouckes, a stronghold
against whose walls the Burgundians plied a great
piece of artillery, an arm which was then only fairly
coming into use. Behind this stood Sir Jacques,
with a number of other nobles, to watch the effect
of the shot. Just then came whizzing through the
air a stone bullet, shot from a culverin on the
walls of the castle, the artillerist being a young man
of Ghent, son of Henry the Blindman. This stone
struck Sir Jacques on the forehead and carried
away the upper half of his head, stretching him
dead on the field. He was yet a young man when
death thus came to him. Only eight years before
he had made his first appearance in the lists, at
Nancy.</p>

<p>Philip the Good was infuriated when he heard of
the loss of his favorite knight. He vowed that
when the Ch&acirc;teau was taken every soul in it should
be hung from the walls. He kept his word, too,
with a few exceptions, these being some priests, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
leprous soldier, and a couple of boys. One of these
lads made his way in all haste to Ghent, and not
until well out of reach of the <i>good</i> Philip did he
reveal the truth, that it was his hand which had
fired the fatal shot.</p>

<p>And so ended the life of our worthy knight-errant,
the prize-fighter of an earlier day than ours,
the main difference between past and present being
that his combats were fought with battle-axe and
sword instead of fists, and that his backers were
princes, his admirers high-born ladies, instead of
the low-lived class of bruisers who now support
such <i>knightly</i> exhibitions. Four centuries and more
have passed since the days of Sir Jacques. It is
to be hoped that long before another century has
passed, there will be an end of all single combats
in civilized lands.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-13" id="h2-13"></a><h2><i>LOUIS THE POLITIC
AND CHARLES THE BOLD.</i></h2>

<p>In the latter half of the fifteenth century Europe
had two notable sovereigns, Louis XI. of France
and Charles the Bold, or Charles the Rash, of Burgundy;
the one famous in history for his intricate
policy, the other for his lack of anything that could
fairly be called policy. The relations between these
two men ranged from open hostility to a peace of
the most fragile character. The policy of Louis
was of the kind that was as likely to get him into
trouble as out of it. The rashness and headstrong
temper of Charles were equally likely to bring
trouble in their train. In all things the two formed
a strongly contrasted pair, and their adjoining
realms could hardly hope for lasting peace while
these men lived.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p147" id="p147"></a>
<img src="images/p147.jpg" alt="LOUIS XI." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">LOUIS XI.</span></div>

<p>The hand of Charles was ever on his sword.
With him the blow quickly followed the word or
the thought. The hand of Louis&mdash;"the universal
spider," as his contemporaries named him&mdash;was
ever on the web of intrigue which he had woven
around him, feeling its filaments, and keeping himself
in touch with every movement of his foes. He
did not like war. That was too direct a means of
gaining his ends. It was his delight to defeat his
enemies by combinations of state policy, to play off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
one against another, and by incessant intrigue to
gain those ends which other men gained by hard
blows.</p>

<p>Yet it is possible for a schemer to overdo himself,
for one who trusts to his plots and his policy
to defeat himself by the very neatness and intricacy
of his combinations, and so it proved on one
occasion in the dealings between these two men.
The incident which we propose to relate forms the
subject of "Quentin Durward," one of the best-known
novels by Sir Walter Scott, and is worth
telling for itself without the allurements of romance.</p>

<p>"Louis had a great idea of the influence he
gained over people by his wits and his language,"
says one of his biographers. "He was always convinced
that people never said what ought to be said,
and that they did not set to work the right way."
He liked to owe success to himself alone, and had
an inordinate opinion of his power both of convincing
and of deceiving people. In consequence, during
one of his periods of strained relations with
Charles of Burgundy, which his agents found it impossible
to settle, this royal schemer determined
to visit Charles in person, and try the effect on his
opponent of the powers of persuasion of which he
was so proud.</p>

<p>It was as rash a project as Charles himself could
have been guilty of. The fox was about to trust
himself in the den of the angry lion. But Louis
persisted, despite the persuasions of his councillors,
sent to Charles for a letter of safe-conduct, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
under its assurance sought the Duke of Burgundy
in his fortified town of P&eacute;ronne, having with him as
escort only fourscore of his Scotch guard and sixty
men-at-arms.</p>

<p>It was a mad movement, and led to consequences
of which Louis had not dreamed. Charles received
him civily enough. Between rash duke and politic
king there was every show of amity. But the negotiations
went on no more rapidly now than they
had done before. And soon came news which
proved that Louis the schemer had, for once at
least, played the fool, and put himself in a position
of the utmost danger.</p>

<p>The policy of the royal spider had been stretched
too far. His webs of plot had unluckily crossed.
In truth, shortly before coming to P&eacute;ronne, he had
sent two secret agents to the town of Li&eacute;ge, to stir
the unruly citizens up to rebellion against the duke.
Quite forgetting this trifle of treachery, the too-hasty
plotter had sought the duke's stronghold with
the hope of placating him with well-concocted lies
and a smooth tongue. Unluckily for him, his
agents did not forget their orders.</p>

<p>The Li&eacute;goise broke out into rebellion, under the
insidious advice of the French king's agents, advanced
and took the town of Tongres, killed some
few people, and made prisoner there the bishop of
Li&eacute;ge and the lord of Humbercourt. The fugitives
who brought this news to P&eacute;ronne made the matter
even worse than this, reporting that the bishop and
lord had probably been killed. Charles believed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
them, and broke into a fury that augured badly for
his guest.</p>

<p>"So the king came here only to deceive me!"
he burst out. "It is he who by his ambassadors
excited these bad folks of Li&eacute;ge! By St. George,
they shall be severely punished for it, and he himself
shall have cause to repent."</p>

<p>The measures taken by the incensed duke were
certainly threatening. The gates of the town and
castle were closed and guarded by archers. Louis
was to all intents and purposes a prisoner, though
the duke, a little ashamed, perhaps, of his action,
affirmed that his purpose was to recover a box of
gold and jewels that had been stolen from him.</p>

<p>The den of the lion had closed on the fox. Now
was the time for the fox to show his boasted wit,
for his position was one of danger. That rash-headed
Duke of Burgundy was never the man to
be played with, and in his rage was as perilous as
dynamite. It was, in truth, an occasion fitted to
draw out all the quickness and shrewdness of mind
of Louis, those faculties on which he prided himself!
To gain friends in the castle he bribed the
household of the duke. As for himself he remained
quiet and apparently easy and unsuspicious, while
alertly watchful to avail himself of any opportunity
to escape from the trap into which he had brought
himself. During the two days that succeeded, the
rage of Charles cooled somewhat. Louis had offered
to swear a peace, to aid Charles in punishing the
Li&eacute;goise for their rebellion, and to leave hostages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
for his good faith. This the angry duke at first
would not listen to. He talked of keeping Louis
a prisoner, and sending for Prince Charles, his
brother, to take on himself the government of
France. The messenger was ready for this errand;
his horse in the court-yard; the letters written.
But the duke's councillors begged him to reflect.
Louis had come under his safe-conduct. His honor
was involved. Such an act would be an eternal
reproach to Burgundy. Charles did reflect, and
slowly began to relent. He had heard again from
Li&eacute;ge. The affair was not so bad as he had been
told. The bishop and lord had been set free. The
violent storm in the duke's mind began to subside.</p>

<p>Early in the next day the irate duke entered the
chamber of the castle in which he held his royal
guest a prisoner. The storm had fallen, but the
waves still ran high. There was courtesy in his
looks, but his voice trembled with anger. The
words that came from his lips were brief and bitter;
there was threat in his manner; Louis looked at
him with more confidence than he felt.</p>

<p>"Brother," he said, "I am safe, am I not, in
your house and your country?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the duke, with an effort at self-repression;
"so safe that if I saw an arrow from
a bow coming towards you I would throw myself
in the way to protect you. But will you not be
pleased to swear to the treaty just as it is written?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I thank you for your good-will," said
Louis, heartily.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"And will you not be pleased to come with me
to Li&eacute;ge to help me punish the treason committed
against me by these Li&eacute;goise, all through you and
your journey hither? The bishop is your near
relative of the house of Bourbon."</p>

<p>"Yes, P&acirc;ques-Dieu!" replied Louis; "and I
am much astounded by their wickedness. But let
us begin by swearing this treaty; and then I will
start with as many or as few of my people as you
please."</p>

<p>"My brother, the fox, is over-willing," may have
been the thought that passed through the duke's
mind. "He is ready to lose his foot to get his
body out of the trap."</p>

<p>But whatever his thoughts, in action he took
prompt measures to bind the slippery king to his
promise. From Louis's boxes was produced the
cross of St. Laud, claimed to be made of the wood
of the true cross, and so named because it was
usually kept in the church of St. Laud, at Angers.
It was said to have belonged to Charlemagne, and
Louis regarded it as the most sacred of relics. On
this the king swore to observe the treaty, though it
contained clauses to which he would not have
assented under other circumstances. The document
was immediately signed. Louis, for the first
moment since learning of his almost fatal blunder,
breathed at ease. As for the second part of his
promise, that of helping Charles to punish the
townsmen whom he had himself stirred to rebellion,
it little troubled his conscience&mdash;if he possessed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
any sentiment that could properly be denominated
by this name.</p>

<p>On the day after the signing of the treaty the two
princes set out together. Charles was followed by
his army, Louis by his modest body-guard, which
had been augmented by three hundred men-at-arms,
just arrived from France. On the 27th of October
[1468] they arrived at the rebellious city. There
seemed no trouble to get into it. No wall or ditch
surrounded it. The duke had previously deprived
it of these obstacles to his armies. But an obstacle
remained in the people, who could not easily be
brought to believe that the king of France and the
Duke of Burgundy, those fire-and water-like potentates,
were true allies. The thing seemed impossible.
Louis was their friend, and would certainly
strike for them. They made a sortie from the city,
shouting, "Hurrah for the king! Hurrah for
France!"</p>

<p>To their consternation, they saw Louis and Duke
Charles together at the head of the advancing army,
the king wearing in his hat the cross of St. Andrew
of Burgundy, his false voice shouting "Hurrah for
Burgundy!"</p>

<p>The surprise of the Li&eacute;goise was shared by many
of the French, whose sense of national honor was
shocked to see so utter a lack of pride and so open
a display of treachery in their monarch. They had
not deemed his boasted policy capable of such baseness.
Louis afterwards excused himself with the
remark, "When pride rides before, shame and hurt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
follow close after," a saying very pretty as a politic
apothegm, but not likely to soothe the wounded
pride of France.</p>

<p>The treachery of Louis roused a different feeling
in the hearts of the Li&eacute;goise,&mdash;that of indignation.
They determined to defend their city, despite its
lack of ramparts, and met the advancing army with
such spirit that it was obliged to convert its assault
into a siege. Night after night the Burgundian
army was troubled by the bold sorties of the citizens.
In one of these the duke and king both were in
danger of capture. At ten o'clock, one night, about
six hundred well-armed men made a sudden assault
upon the duke's quarters. They were ill-defended.
Charles was in bed. Only twelve archers were on
guard, and these were playing at dice. The assault
came with startling suddenness. The archers seized
their arms, but had great difficulty in defending
the door-way. Charles hastened to put on breast-plate
and helmet and to join them. But only the
opportune arrival of aid saved him from being
seized in the midst of his army.</p>

<p>Louis ran a similar danger. His quarters had
simultaneously been attacked. Luckily for him, his
Scotch guardsmen were more ready than those of
Burgundy. They repulsed the attack, with little
heed whether their arrows killed hostile Li&eacute;goise
or friendly Burgundians. As for the assailants,
they found it easier to get into the French camp
than out of it. They were killed almost to a man.</p>

<p>On the next day the duke and his councillors determined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
on an assault. The king was not present,
and when he heard of it he did not favor the plan.</p>

<p>"You have seen the courage of these people," he
remarked. "You know how murderous and uncertain
is street-fighting. You will lose many brave
men to no purpose. Wait two or three days, and
the Li&eacute;goise will certainly come to terms."</p>

<p>Most of the Burgundian captains were of the
same opinion. The duke, whose rash spirit could
ill brook opposition, grew angry.</p>

<p>"He wishes to spare the Li&eacute;goise," he angrily
exclaimed. "What danger is there in this assault?
There are no walls; they cannot put a single gun
in position; I certainly will not give up the assault.
If the king is afraid, let him get him gone to
Namur."</p>

<p>This insult to the king, which shocked the Burgundians
themselves, was repeated to him, and
received in silence. He had made up his mind to
drain the cup of humiliation to the dregs. The
next day, October 30, the assault was made, Charles
at the head of his troops. Louis came up to join
him.</p>

<p>"Bide your time," said Charles. "Put not yourself
uselessly in danger. I will send you word
when it is time."</p>

<p>"Lead on, brother," answered Louis. "You are
the most fortunate prince alive; I will follow you."</p>

<p>On they marched&mdash;into, as it proved, an undefended
city. The Li&eacute;goise had been discouraged
by the fall of many of their bravest men. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Sunday; no attack was looked for; "the cloth
was laid in every house, and all were preparing
for dinner"; the Burgundians moved through
empty streets, Louis following with his own escort,
and shouting, "Hurrah for Burgundy!"</p>

<p>By mid-day the vengeance of Charles was complete;
the town had been pillaged; there was nothing
left to take in house or church; many a floor
was stained with blood; Li&eacute;ge for the time was
ruined.</p>

<p>As for the arch-deceiver to whom all this was
due, he completed his work of baseness by loading
the duke with praises, his tone and manner so courteous
and amiable that Charles lost the last shreds
of his recent anger.</p>

<p>"Brother," said the king the next day, "if you
still need my help, do not spare me. But if you
have nothing more for me to do, it would be well
for me to go back to Paris, to make public in my
court of parliament the arrangement we have come
to together; otherwise it would risk becoming of
no avail. You know that such is the custom of
France. Next summer we must meet again. You
will come into your duchy of Burgundy, and I will
go and pay you a visit, and we will pass a week
joyously together in making good cheer."</p>

<p>It may be that this smooth speech was accompanied
by a mental commentary,&mdash;"Let me once get
from under your claws, my playful tiger, and I will
not be fool enough to put myself back there again,"&mdash;but
if so nothing of the kind appeared on his
face.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles made no answer. He sent for the treaty,
and left it to the king to confirm or renounce it,
as he would. Louis expressed himself as fully satisfied
with its terms, and on the next day, November
2, set out on his return to France. Charles kept
him company for some distance. On parting, the
king said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If my brother Charles, who is in Brittany,
should not be content with the assignment which
I, for love of you, have made him, what would you
have me do?"</p>

<p>"If he do not please to take it, but would have
you otherwise satisfy him, I leave that to the two
of you to settle," said Charles.</p>

<p>With these words he turned back, leaving Louis
to pursue his way free once more, "after having
passed the most trying three weeks of his life."</p>

<p>That the fox kept faith with the lion, or the lion
with the fox, is not to be looked for. New disputes
broke out, new battles were fought,&mdash;not now in
alliance,&mdash;and the happiest day in the life of Louis
XI. was that in which he heard that Charles of
Burgundy, the constant thorn in his chaplet, had
fallen on the fatal field of Nancy, and that France
was freed from the threatening presence of the bold
and passionate duke.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span><br /><br /><br /></p>



<a name="h2-14" id="h2-14"></a><h2><i>CHARLES THE BOLD
AND THE SWISS.</i></h2>


<p>On the 6th of February, 1476, Duke Charles of
Burgundy marched from Besan&ccedil;on to take the field
against the Swiss, between whom and Burgundy
hostilities had broken out. There were three parties
to this war, Louis XI. being the third. That
politic monarch had covertly stirred up the Swiss
to their hostile attitude, promised them aid in
money, if not in men, and now had his secret agents
in both camps, and kept himself in readiness to
take advantage of every circumstance that might
be turned to his own benefit. Leaving Tours, he
went to Lyons, that he might be within easy distance
of the seat of war. And not long had he been
there before news of the most gratifying character
came to his ears, Duke Charles had met the foe,
and&mdash;but we anticipate.</p>

<p>The army of Burgundy was a powerful one, having
not less than thirty or forty thousand men
and a strong train of artillery. It was followed, as
was Charles's fashion in making war, with an
immense baggage-train. Personally his habits were
simple and careless, but he loved to display his riches
and magnificance, and made his marches and encampments
as much scenes of festival as of war.
What this showy duke wanted from their poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
cities and barren country the Swiss could not very
well see. "The spurs and the horses' bits in his
army are worth more money than the whole of us
could pay in ransom if we were all taken," they
said.</p>

<p>Without regard to this, Charles marched on, and
on February 19 reached Granson, a little town in
the district of Vaud. Here fighting had taken
place, and hither soon came the Swiss battalions.
Powerful fellows they were, bold and sturdy, and
animated with the highest spirit of freedom. On
they marched, timing their long strides to the
lowings of the "bull of Uri" and the "cow of
Unterwalden," two great trumpets of buffalo horn
which, as was claimed, Charlemagne had given to
their ancestors.</p>

<p>Against these compact battalions, armed with
spears eighteen feet long, the squadrons of Burgundy
rode in vain. Their lines were impregnable.
Their enemies fell in numbers. In the end the
whole Burgundian army, seized with panic, broke
and fled, "like smoke before the northern blast."</p>

<p>So sudden and complete was the defeat that
Charles himself had to take to flight with only five
horsemen for escort, and with such haste that everything
was left in the hands of the foe,&mdash;camp, artillery,
treasure, the duke's personal jewels, even his
very cap with its garniture of precious stones and
his collar of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>The Swiss were as ignorant of the value of their
booty as they were astonished at the completeness
of their victory. Jewels, gold, silver, rich hangings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
precious tapestry, had little value in their
eyes. They sold the silver plate for a few pence,
taking it for pewter. The silks and velvets found
in the baggage-wagons of the duke, the rich cloth
of gold and damask, the precious Flanders lace and
Arras carpets, were cut in pieces and distributed
among the peasant soldiers as if they had been so
much common canvas. Most notable of all was the
fate of the great diamond of the duke, which had
once glittered in the crown of the Great Mogul,
and was of inestimable value. This prize was
found on the road, inside a little box set with fine
pearls. The man who picked it up thought the box
pretty and worth keeping, but saw no use for that
bit of shining glass inside. He threw this contemptuously
away. Afterwards he thought it
might be worth something, to be so carefully kept,
and went back to look for it. He found it under
a wagon, and sold it to a clergyman in the neighborhood
for a crown. This precious stone, one of
the few great diamonds in the world, is now in the
possession of the Emperor of Austria, its value
enhanced to him, it may be, by its strange history.</p>

<p>There was only one thing in this event that did
not please Louis XI.,&mdash;that Charles had left the
field alive. He sent him advice, indeed, to let those
poor folks but hard fighters of the Alps alone, well
convinced that the fiery duke would not take his
counsel. In truth, Charles, mad with rage, ordered
that all the soldiers who had fled from the field
should be put to death, and that the new recruits
to be raised should be dealt with in the same manner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
if they did not march to his camp with all haste.
It cannot be said that this insane command was
obeyed, but so intense was his energy, and so fierce
his rage against the Swiss, that in no great time
he had a fresh army, of from twenty-five to thirty
thousand men, composed of Burgundians, Flemings,
Italians, and English.</p>

<p>Late in May he was again on the march,&mdash;with
much less parade and display than before,&mdash;and on
the 10th of June pitched his camp before the little
town of Morat, six leagues from Berne.</p>

<p>Everywhere as he went he left word that it was
war to the death on which he was bent. His pride
had been bitterly wounded. He vowed to heal it
in the blood of his foes.</p>

<p>The Swiss were preparing with all haste, and
advancing to Berne. The governor of Morat sent
them word to be at ease concerning him. "I will
defend Morat," he said, and to garrison and people
he swore that he would hang the first who spoke
of surrender. For ten days he had held out against
Charles's whole army, while his countrymen were
gathering.</p>

<p>The men of Zurich were the last to reach Berne.
On the 21st of June, in the evening, the Swiss
encamped near their foes.</p>

<p>"Have those hounds lost heart, pray?" the
duke had just said; "I was told that we were
about to get at them."</p>

<p>His wish was to be gratified in a way he had not
meant; they were about to get at him. The next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
day, June 22, opened with a pelting rain. Later,
the sun burst through the clouds. With its first
beams the Swiss were in motion, marching on the
camp of their foes.</p>

<p>A man-at-arms hurried to the duke's tent, and
told him that the Swiss were coming, and that they
had attacked the lines. He declared the story was
a lie, and drove the messenger with an insulting
reproof from his tent. What, these base peasants?
To attack his army? The thing was incredible!
For all that, he left the tent and hurried to the
point indicated. It was true, they had attacked,
and were already driving back his men.</p>

<p>Charles rallied them as he best could. The battle
was desperate. All the remainder of the day it
continued. But before nightfall the Swiss were
everywhere victorious, the Burgundians everywhere
beaten. Charles had still three thousand horsemen,
but they, too, broke before the fierce charges
of the Swiss, and in the end he escaped with difficulty,
having but a dozen men at his back, and
leaving eight or ten thousand of his soldiers dead
on the field, the greater part of them killed after
the fight by the relentlessly furious Swiss.</p>

<p>Charles, obstinate, furious, wild with rage, sought
to collect another army, but failed. No men could
be found willing to bear arms against those terrible
Swiss. He shut himself up for weeks in one of his
castles, dismayed, inconsolable, heated with passion,
ready to crush the world if his hand could
have grasped it, a sorry spectacle of disappointed
ambition and overthrown pride.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Other enemies rose against him. Ren&eacute; II., duke
of Lorraine, whom he had robbed of his dominions
and driven from Nancy, now saw an opportunity
to recover his heritage. He had been wandering
like a fugitive from court to court. Before Morat
he had joined the Swiss, and helped them to their
victory. Now, gathering a force, he re-entered his
duchy, besieged Nancy, then feebly garrisoned, and
pressed it hard. The governor sent messengers to
Duke Charles, asking for aid. He received none.
The duke did not even reply to him. He seemed
utterly dispirited. In this emergency the governor
surrendered, and Ren&eacute; had his own again.</p>

<p>Yet at that very moment, Charles the Bold,
throwing off his apathy, was marching upon Lorraine,
with a small army which he had hastily collected.
On the 22d of October, 1476, he reached
Nancy, which was once more besieged. At his
approach, Duke Ren&eacute; left the town, but left it well
garrisoned. He went in search of reinforcements.
These he found in Switzerland, the agents of Louis
XI. promising them good pay, while their hatred
of Charles made them fully ready for the service.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1477, Ren&eacute;, having led his new
army to Lorraine, found himself face to face with
the army of Charles the Bold, who was still besieging
Nancy. Charles held council with his captains.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "since these drunken scoundrels
are upon us, and are coming here to look for meat
and drink, what ought we to do?"</p>

<p>"Fall back," was the general opinion. "They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
outnumber us. We should recruit our army. Duke
Ren&eacute; is poor. He will not long be able to bear
the expense of the war, and his allies will leave him
as soon as his money is gone. Wait but a little,
and success is certain."</p>

<p>The duke burst into one of his usual fits of passion.</p>

<p>"My father and I," he cried, "knew how to
thrash these Lorrainers, and we will make them remember
it. By St. George, I will not fly before a
boy, before Ren&eacute; of Vaudemont, who is coming at
the head of this scum! He has not so many men
with him as people think; the Germans have no
idea of leaving their stoves in winter. This evening
we will deliver the assault against the town,
and to-morrow we will give battle."</p>

<p>He did give battle on the morrow,&mdash;his last, as
it proved. The fray did not last long, nor was the
loss of life in the field great. But the Burgundians
broke and fled, and the pursuit was terrible, the
Lorrainers and their Swiss and German allies pursuing
hotly, and killing all they found. Ren&eacute; entered
Nancy in triumph, and relieved the citizens
from the famine from which they had long suffered.
To show him what they had endured in his cause,
there were piled up before his door "the heads of
the horses, dogs, mules, cats, and other unclean
animals which had for several weeks past been the
only food of the besieged."</p>

<p>The battle over, the question arose, what had
become of the Duke of Burgundy? None could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
answer. Some said a servant had carried him
wounded from the field; others, that a German lord
held him prisoner. But a page soon appeared who
said he had seen him fall and could lead to the
spot. He did so, conducting a party to a pond
near the town, where, half buried in the mud, lay
several dead bodies lately stripped. Among the
searchers was a poor washerwoman, who, seeing the
glitter of a ring on the finger of one of the corpses,
turned it over, and cried, "Ah! my prince!"</p>

<p>All rushed to the spot. The body was examined
with care. There was no doubt, it was that of
Charles of Burgundy. His rash and violent disposition
had at length borne the fruit that might
have been anticipated, and brought him to an end
which gave the highest satisfaction to many of his
foes, and to none more than to Louis XI. of France.
He was buried with great pomp, by the order of
Duke Ren&eacute;. In 1550 the emperor Charles V., his
great grandson, had his body taken to Bruges, and
placed on the tomb the following inscription:</p>

<p>"Here lieth the most high, mighty, and magnanimous
prince, Charles, Duke of Burgundy, ...
the which, being mightily endowed with strength,
firmness, and magnanimity, prospered awhile in
high enterprises, battles, and victories, as well at
Montlh&eacute;ry, in Normandy, in Artois, and in Li&eacute;ge,
as elsewhere, until fortune, turning her back on
him, thus crushed him before Nancy."</p>

<p>To-day it might be written on his tomb, "His
was a fitting end to a violent, lawless, and blood-thirsty
career."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-15" id="h2-15"></a><h2><i>BAYARD, THE GOOD KNIGHT.</i></h2>

<p>Good knights were abundant in the romance of
the age of chivalry; they seem to have been greatly
lacking in its history. Of knights without fear
there were many; of knights "without fear and
without reproach" we are specially told of but one,
Pierre du Terrail, Chevalier de Bayard, "<i>Le chevalier
sans peur et sans reproche</i>." Many are the
stories of the courage, the justice, the honor, the
mercy, the intrepidity in war, the humanity and
kindliness of spirit in peace, which make this admirable
character an anomaly in that age of courteous
appearance and brutal reality yclept the "age
of chivalry." One such story we have to tell.</p>

<p>The town of Brescia had been taken by the French
army under Gaston de Foix, and given up to pillage
by his troops, with all the horrors which this meant
in that day of license and inhumanity. Bayard
took part in the assault on the town, and was
wounded therein, so severely that he said to his
fellow-captain, the lord of Molart,&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Comrade, march your men forward; the town is
ours. As for me, I cannot pull on farther, for I am
a dead man."</p>

<p>Not quite dead, as it proved. He had many
years of noble deeds before him still. When the
town was taken, two of his archers bore him to a
house whose size and show of importance attracted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
them as a fair harbor for their lord. It was the
residence of a rich citizen, who had fled for safety
to a monastery, leaving his wife to God's care in
the house, and two fair daughters to such security
as they could gain from the hay in a granary, under
which they were hidden.</p>

<p>At the loud summons of the archers the lady
tremblingly opened the door, and was surprised and
relieved when she saw that it was a wounded knight
who craved admittance. Sadly hurt as Bayard was,
his instinct of kindness remained active. He bade
the archers to close the door and remain there on
guard.</p>

<p>"Take heed, for your lives," he said, "that none
enter here unless they be some of my own people.
I am sure that, when this is known to be my quarters,
none will try to force a way in. If, by your
aiding me, you miss a chance of gain in the sack of
the town, let not that trouble you; you shall lose
nothing by your service."</p>

<p>The archers obeyed, and the wounded knight was
borne to a rich chamber, the lady herself showing
the way. When he had been laid in bed, she threw
herself on her knees before him, and pleadingly
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noble sir, I present you this house and all that
is therein, all of which, in truth, I well know to be
yours by right of war. But I earnestly pray that it
be your pleasure to spare me and my two young
daughters our lives and honor."</p>

<p>"Madam," answered the knight, with grave courtesy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
"I know not if I can escape from my wound;
but, so long as I live, trust me that no harm shall
come to you and your daughters, any more than to
myself. Only keep them in their chambers; let
them not be seen; and I assure you that no man in
the house will take upon himself to enter any place
against your will."</p>

<p>These words the lady heard with joy, and on
Bayard's request that he should have a good surgeon
without delay, she and one of the archers set
out in quest of the best that could be found. Fortunately,
it proved that the knight's wound, though
deep, was not mortal. At the second dressing
Master Claude, the surgeon of Gaston de Foix, took
him in hand, and afterwards attended him assiduously
until his wound was healed, a process which
took about a month. After the first dressing of the
wound, Bayard asked his hostess, in kindly tones,
where her husband was.</p>

<p>"I know not, my lord, if he be dead or alive,"
she answered, bursting into tears. "If he be living,
I am sure he has taken refuge in a monastery where
he is well known."</p>

<p>"Let him return home," answered Bayard. "I
shall send those after him who will see that he has
no harm."</p>

<p>The lady, elate with hope, sent to inquire, and
found that her husband was really where she had
supposed. Bayard's steward and the two archers
were sent for him, and conducted him safely
through the turmoil of the streets, where war's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
ravage, in its worst form, was still afoot. On his
arrival, the knight received him with a courteous
welcome, and bade him not to be alarmed, as only
friends were quartered upon him, and he should
suffer no loss in person or estate.</p>

<p>For a month the wounded knight lay on his couch,
where, though he was made as comfortable as possible
by the assiduous ministrations of his grateful
host and hostess, he suffered much from his hurt.
At the end of that time he was able to rise and walk
across the chamber, though still very weak. But
news came that a great battle between the French
and the Spaniards was likely soon to be fought, and
the brave Bayard burned with warlike desire to take
part in the conflict.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," he said to the surgeon, "tell
me if there is any danger in setting me on the
march. It seems to me that I am well, or nearly
so; and, in my judgment, to stay here longer will
do me more harm than good, for I fret sorely to be
thus tied."</p>

<p>"Your wound is not yet closed," said the surgeon,
"though it is quite healed inside. After another
dressing you may be able to ride, provided that
your barber attends to dressing it with ointment and
a little lint every day. The worst of the wound is
now on the surface, and, as it will not touch your
saddle, you will run no risk in riding."</p>

<p>Bayard heard these words with gladness, and at
once gave orders to his people to prepare for the
road, as he would set out for the army in two days.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, his host and hostess and their children
were far from well at ease. Until now their
guest had protected and spared them, but they
knew too well the habits of soldiers to imagine that
he intended to do this without being abundantly
paid for the service. They held themselves as his
prisoners, and feared that he might yet force them
to ransom themselves with the utmost sum their
estate would afford, perhaps ten or twelve thousand
crowns. Yet he had been so gentle and kindly that
the good lady entertained hopes that he might prove
generous, if softened by a suitable present. Therefore,
on the morning of the day which he had
fixed for his departure, she appeared in his chamber,
followed by a servant who carried a small steel
box.</p>

<p>Bayard had been walking up and down the room
to try his leg, and had now thrown himself into a
chair to rest. The lady fell upon her knees before
him; but before he would permit her to speak he
insisted that she should rise and be seated.</p>

<p>"My lord," she began, "I can never be thankful
enough for the grace which God did me, at the
taking of this town, in directing you to this our
house. We owe to you our lives and all that we
hold dear. Moreover, from the time that you
arrived here, neither I nor the least of my people
have endured a single insult, but all has been good-will
and courtesy, nor have your folks taken a
farthing's worth of our goods without paying for
them. I am aware that my husband, myself, my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
children, and all my household are your prisoners,
to be dealt with according to your good pleasure,
in person and goods; but, knowing the nobleness of
your heart, I am come to entreat you humbly to
have pity on us, and extend to us your wonted
generosity. Here is a little present we make you;
and we pray that you may be pleased to take it in
good part."</p>

<p>She opened the box which the servant held, and
Bayard saw that it was filled with golden coins.
The free-hearted knight, who had never in his life
troubled himself about money, burst out laughing,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, how many ducats are there in this
box?"</p>

<p>His action, so different from what she expected,
frightened the poor woman. Thinking it to indicate
that the sum was below his expectations, she
said hurriedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, there are but two thousand five hundred
ducats; but, if you are not content, we will
find a larger sum."</p>

<p>"By my faith, madam," he warmly replied,
"though you should give a hundred thousand
crowns, you would not do as well towards me as
you have done by the good cheer I have had here
and the kind attendance you have given me. In
whatsoever place I may happen to be, you will have,
so long as God shall grant me life, a gentleman at
your bidding. As for your ducats, I will have none
of them, and yet I thank you; take them back;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
all my life I have always loved people much more
than crowns. And take my word for it that I go
away as well pleased with you as if this town were
at your disposal and you had given it to me."</p>

<p>The good lady listened to him with deep astonishment.
Never had she dreamed of such a marvel
as this, a soldier who did not crave money. She
was really distressed by his decision.</p>

<p>"My lord," she said, "I shall feel myself the
most wretched creature in the world if you will not
take this small present, which is nothing in comparison
with your past courtesy and present kindness."</p>

<p>Seeing how firm she was in her purpose, he said,
with a gentle smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will take it for love of you; but
go and fetch me your two daughters, for I would
fain bid them farewell."</p>

<p>Much pleased with his acceptance, the lady left
the room in search of her daughters, whom the
knight knew well, for they had solaced many of the
weary hours of his illness with pleasant chat, and
music from their voices and from the lute and
spinet, on which they played agreeably. While
awaiting them he bade the servant to empty the
box and count the ducats into three lots, two of a
thousand each and one of five hundred.</p>

<p>When the young ladies entered, they would have
fallen on their knees as their mother had done before
them, but Bayard would not consent that they
should remain in this humble attitude.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lord," said the elder, "these two poor
girls, who owe so much to your kindness, are come
to take leave of you, and humbly to thank your
lordship for your goodness, for which they can make
no return other than to pray that God may hold
you in His good care."</p>

<p>"Dear damsels," answered Bayard, much affected,
"you have done what I ought to do; that is, to
thank you for your good company, for which I am
much beholden. You know that fighting men are
not likely to be laden with pretty things to present
to ladies. I am sorry not to be better provided.
But here are some ducats brought me by your lady-mother.
Of these I give to each of you a thousand
towards your marriage; and for my recompense
you shall, if it please you, pray God for me, as you
have offered."</p>

<p>He swept the ducats from the table into their
aprons, forcing them to accept them whether they
would or not. Then, turning to his hostess, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, I will take these five hundred ducats
that remain for my own profit, to distribute among
the poor sisterhoods of this town which have been
plundered; and to you I commit the charge of them,
since you, better than any other, will understand
where they are most needed. And with this mission
I take my leave of you."</p>

<p>Then he bade them adieu by touching their
hands, after the Italian fashion, "and they fell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
upon their knees, weeping so bitterly that it seemed
as if they were to be led out to their deaths."</p>

<p>The dinner hour came and passed. When it was
over the knight quickly left the table and called for
his horses, being eager to be gone for fear the two
armies might come to battle in his absence. As he
left his chamber to seek his horse, the two fair
daughters of the house came down to bid him a final
farewell and to make him presents which they had
worked for him during his illness.</p>

<p>One gave him a pair of pretty and delicate bracelets,
made of gold and silver thread, worked with
marvellous neatness. The other presented him a
handsome purse of crimson satin very cleverly
ornamented with the needle. The knight received
these graceful gifts with warm thanks, saying that
presents which came from hands so fair were more
to him than a hundred-fold their value in gold.
To do them the more honor, he put the bracelets on
his wrists and the purse in his sleeve, and assured
them that, as long as they lasted, he would wear
them for love of the givers.</p>

<p>Then, mounting, the good knight rode away,
leaving more tears of joy and heartfelt gratitude
behind him than can be said of few soldiers since
the world began. It was not for fame he had
wrought, or of fame he had thought, but he won
high fame by his generous behavior, for his treatment
of his Brescian hosts is still quoted as the
rarest deed in his chaplet of good actions.</p>

<p>The two archers who had stayed with Bayard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
failed not to receive the promised reward. Gaston
de Foix, the Duke of Nemours, sent the knight a
number of presents, among them five hundred
crowns, and these he divided between the archers
whom he had debarred from their share of the
spoil.</p>

<p>It will suffice to say, in conclusion, that he
reached the army in time to take part in the battle
that followed, and to add therein to his fame as
a "good knight without fear."

<a name="h2-16" id="h2-16"></a><h2><i>EPISODES IN THE LIFE OF
A TRAITOR.</i></h2>


<p>At the early hour of one o'clock in the morning
of September 8, 1523, a train of men-at-arms and
servants, headed by a tall, stern-faced, soldierly-looking
man, rode from the gates of the strong
castle of Chantelle, and headed southward in the
direction of Spain. The leader was dressed in
armor, and carried sword by side and battle-axe
at his saddle-bow. Of his followers, some fifteen
of them were attired in a peculiar manner, wearing
thick jackets of woollen cloth that seemed as stiff
as iron mail, and jingled metallically as they rode.
Mail they were, capable of turning arrow or spear
thrust, but mail of gold, not of iron, for in those
jackets were sewed up thirty thousand crowns of
gold, and their wearers served as the ambulatory
treasury of the proud soldier at their head.</p>

<p>This man was no less a personage than Charles,
Duke of Bourbon, Constable of France, the highest
personage in the kingdom next to the monarch
himself, but now in flight from that monarch, and
from the soldiers who were marching to environ
Chantelle and carry him as a prisoner to the king.
There had been bad blood between Bourbon and
Francis I., pride and haughtiness on the one side,
injustice and indecision on the other; wrong to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
subject, defiance to the king; and now the "short-tempered"
noble and great soldier had made a
moonlight flitting, bent on cutting loose from his
allegiance to France, and on lending the aid of his
sword and military skill to her hereditary foes.</p>

<p>For a month Bourbon and his followers wandered
around the provinces of southern France. Incessantly
he changed his road, his costume, his companions,
his resting-place, occasionally falling in
with soldiers of the king who were on their way to
take part in the wars in Italy, seeking in vain for
adherents to his cause, and feeling his way by correspondence
to an understanding with the enemies of
France. In early October he entered the domains
of the emperor, Charles V., and definitely cut loose
from his allegiance to the king.</p>

<p>The news of this defection filled Francis with
alarm. He had, by his injustice, driven his greatest
soldier from the realm, and now sought to undo
the perilous work he had done. He put off his
journey to join the army marching to Italy, and
sent a messenger to the redoubtable fugitive, offering
restitution of his property, satisfaction in full
of his claims, and security for good treatment and
punctual payment. Bourbon curtly refused.</p>

<p>"It is too late," he said.</p>

<p>"Then," said the envoy, "I am bidden by the
king to ask you to deliver up the sword of constable
and the collar of the order of St. Michael."</p>

<p>"You may tell the king," answered Bourbon,
shortly, "that he took from me the sword of constable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
on the day that he took from me the command
of the advanced guard to give it to M. d'Alen&ccedil;on.
As for the collar of his order, you will find
it at Chantelle under the pillow of my bed."</p>

<p>Francis made further efforts to win back the powerful
noble whom he had so deeply offended, but
equally in vain. Bourbon had definitely cut loose
from his native land and was bent on joining hands
with its mortal foes. Francis had offended him too
deeply to be so readily forgiven as he hoped.</p>

<p>It is not the story of the life of this notable traitor
that we propose to tell, but simply to depict some
picturesque scenes in his career. Charles V. gladly
welcomed him, and made him his lieutenant-general
in Italy, so that he became leader against the French
in their invasion of that land. We next find him
during the siege of Milan by the army of Francis I.,
one of whose leaders was Chevalier Bayard, "the
good knight," who was the subject of our last
story. The siege was destined to prove a fatal affair
for this noble warrior. The French found themselves
so hard pressed by the imperial army under
the Constable de Bourbon that they fell back to
await reinforcements. Near Romagnano, on the
banks of the Sesia, they were thrown into disorder
while seeking to pass the stream, and Bonnivet,
their leader, was severely wounded. The Count de
St. Pol and Chevalier Bayard took command.
Bayard, always first in advance and last in retreat,
charged the enemy at the head of a body of men-at-arms.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
It proved for him a fatal charge. A shot
from an arquebuse gave him a mortal wound.</p>

<p>"Jesus, my God," he cried, "I am dead!"</p>

<p>He took his sword by the handle, kissed its cross-hilt
as an act of devotion, and repeated the <i>Miserere</i>,&mdash;"Have
pity on me, O God, according to Thy
great mercy!"</p>

<p>In a moment more he grew deathly pale and
grasped the pommel of the saddle to keep him from
falling, remaining thus until one of his followers
helped him to dismount, and placed him at the foot
of a tree.</p>

<p>The French were repulsed, leaving the wounded
knight within the lines of the enemy. Word of
Bayard's plight was quickly brought to Bourbon,
who came up with a face filled with sympathetic
feeling.</p>

<p>"Bayard, my good friend, I am sore distressed
at your mishap," he said. "There is nothing for
it but patience. Give not way to melancholy. I
will send in quest of the best surgeons in this country,
and, by God's help, you will soon be healed."</p>

<p>Bayard looked up at him with dying eyes, full
of pity and reproach.</p>

<p>"My lord, I thank you," he said, "but pity is
not for me, who die like a true man, serving my
king; pity is for you, who bear arms against your
prince, your country, and your oath."</p>

<p>Bourbon made no answer. He turned and withdrew,
doubtless stung to the soul by the reproachful
words of the noblest and honestest man of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
age. His own conscience must have added a double
sting to Bayard's words. Such is the bitterest reward
of treason; it dares not look integrity in the
face.</p>

<p>Bayard lived for two or three hours afterwards,
surrounded by his friends, who would not leave him,
though he bade them do so to escape falling into
the enemy's hands. They had nothing to fear.
Both armies mourned the loss of the good knight,
with equal grief. Five days after his death, on
May 5, 1524, Beaurain wrote to Charles V.,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, albeit Sir Bayard was your enemy's servant,
yet was it pity of his death, for he was a gentle
knight, well beloved of every one, and one that
lived as good a life as ever any man of his condition.
And, in truth, he fully showed it by his end, for it
was the most beautiful that I ever heard tell of."</p>

<p>So passed away a man who lived fully up to the
principles of chivalry, and whose honesty, modesty,
sympathy, and valor have given him undying fame.
His name survives as an example of what chivalry
might have been had man been as Christian in
nature as in name, but of what it rarely was, except
in theory.</p>

<p>The next picture we shall draw belongs to the
date of February 24, 1525. Francis I. had for
months been besieging Pavia. Bourbon came to its
relief. A battle followed, which at first seemed to
favor the French, but which Bourbon's skill soon
turned in favor of the Imperialists. Seeing his
ranks breaking on all sides, Francis, inspired by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
fury and despair, desperately charged the enemy
with such knights and men-at-arms as he could
get to follow him. The conflict was fierce and
fatal. Around the king fell his ablest warriors,&mdash;Marshal
de Foix, Francis of Lorraine, Bussy d'Amboise,
La Tr&eacute;moille, and many others. At sight
of this terrible slaughter, Admiral Bonnivet, under
the king the leader of the French host, exclaimed, in
accents of despair, "I can never survive this fearful
havoc." Raising the visor of his helmet, he rushed
desperately forward where a tempest of balls was
sweeping the field, and in a moment fell beside his
slain comrades.</p>

<p>Francis fought on amid the heaps of dead and
dying, his soul filled with the battle rage, his
heart burning with fury and desperation. He
was wounded in face, arms, and legs, yet still his
heavy sword swept right and left, still men fell
before his vigorous blows. His horse, mortally
wounded, sank under him, dragging him down. In
an instant he was up again, laying about him
shrewdly. Two Spaniards who pressed him closely
fell before the sweep of that great blade. Alone
among his foes he fought on, a crowd of hostile
soldiers around him. Who he was they knew not,
but his size, strength, and courage, the golden lilies
which studded his coat of mail, the plume of costly
feathers which waved from his helmet, told them
that this must be one of the greatest men in the
French array.</p>

<p>Despite the strength and intrepid valor of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
king, his danger was increasing minute by minute,
when the Lord of Pomp&eacute;rant, one of Bourbon's intimate
friends, pressed up through the mass and
recognized the warrior who stood like a wounded
lion at bay amid a pack of wolves.</p>

<p>"Back! back!" he cried, springing forward, and
beating off the soldiers with his sword. "Leave
this man to me."</p>

<p>Pressing to the king's side, he still beat back his
foes, saying to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yield, my liege! You stand alone. If you
fight longer, I cannot answer for your life. Look!
there is no hope for you. The Duke of Bourbon
is not far off. Let me send for him to receive your
sword."</p>

<p>The visor of the king hid the look with which he
must have received these words. But from the
helmet's iron depths came in hollow tones the reply
of Francis of France to this appeal.</p>

<p>"No," he cried, sternly, "rather would I die the
death than pledge my faith to Bourbon the traitor!
Where is the Viceroy of Naples?"</p>

<p>Lannoy, the viceroy, was in a distant part of the
field. Some time was lost in finding and bringing
him to the spot. At length he arrived, and fell
upon one knee before Francis, who presented him
his sword. Lannoy took it with a show of the profoundest
respect, and immediately gave him another
in its place. The battle was over, and the king
of France was a prisoner in the hands of his rebellious
subject, the Duke of Bourbon. The wheel
of fate had strangely turned.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The captive king had shown himself a poor general,
but an heroic soldier. His victors viewed him
with admiration for his prowess. When he sat at
table, after having his wounds, which were slight,
dressed, Bourbon approached him respectfully and
handed him a dinner napkin. Francis took it, but
with the most distant and curt politeness. The next
day an interview took place between Bourbon and
the king, in reference to the position of the latter
as captive. In this Francis displayed the same
frigidity of manner as before, while he was all cordiality
with Pescara, Bourbon's fellow in command.
The two leaders claimed Francis as their own captive,
but Lannoy, to whom he had surrendered,
had him embarked for Naples, and instead of
taking him there, sent him directly to Spain, where
he was delivered up to Charles V. Thus ended this
episode in the life of the Constable de Bourbon.</p>

<p>We have still another, and the closing, scene to
present in the life of this great soldier and traitor.
It is of no less interest than those that have gone
before. Historically it is of far deeper interest,
for it was attended with a destruction of inestimable
material that has rarely been excelled. The
world is the poorer that Bourbon lived.</p>

<p>In Spain he had been treated with consideration
by the emperor, but with disdain by many of the
lords, who despised him as a traitor. Charles V.
asked the Marquis de Villena to give quarters in his
palace to the duke.</p>

<p>"I can refuse the emperor nothing," he replied;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
"but as soon as the <i>traitor</i> is out of my house I shall
set it on fire with my own hand. No man of honor
could live in it again."</p>

<p>Despite this feeling, the military record of Bourbon
could not be set aside. He was the greatest
general of his time, and, recognizing this, Charles
again placed him in command of his armies in Italy.
On going there, Bourbon found that there was nothing
that could be called an army. Everything was
in disorder and the imperial cause almost at an
end. In this state of affairs, Bourbon became filled
with hopes of great conquests and high fame for
himself. Filled with the spirit of adventure, and
finding the Spanish army devoted to him, he added
to it some fifteen thousand of German lanzknechts,
most of them Lutherans.</p>

<p>Addressing this greedy horde of soldiers of fortune,
he told them that he was now but a poor gentleman,
like themselves, and promised that if they
would follow him he would make them rich or die
in the attempt. Finishing his remarks, which were
greeted with enthusiastic cheers, he distributed
among them all his money and jewels, keeping little
more than his clothes and armor for himself.</p>

<p>"We will follow you everywhere, to the devil
himself!" shouted the wild horde of adventurers.
"No more of Julius C&aelig;sar, Hannibal, and Scipio!
Hurrah for the fame of Bourbon!"</p>

<p>Putting himself at the head of this tumultuous
array, the duke led them southward through Italy,
halting before Bologna, Florence, and other towns,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
with a half-formed purpose to besiege them, but
in the end pushing on without an assault until,
on the 5th of May, 1527, his horde of land pirates
came in sight of Rome itself.</p>

<p>The imperial city, after being sacked by the
Goths, Vandals, and other barbarians, had remained
without serious damage for a thousand years, but
now another army was encamped under its walls,
and one equally bent on havoc and ruin with those
of the past.</p>

<p>"Now is the time to show courage, manliness,
and the strength of your bodies," said Bourbon
to his followers. "If in this bout you are victorious,
you will be rich lords and well off for the rest
of your lives. Yonder is the city whereof, in times
past, a wise astrologer prophesied concerning me,
telling me that I should die there; but I swear to
you that I care but little for dying there if, when
I die, my corpse be left with endless glory and
renown throughout the world."</p>

<p>He then bade them to retire for the night, ordering
them to be ready betimes in the morning for
the assault, which would take place at an early hour
on that day. Hardly, indeed, had the stars faded
before the sunrise of May 6, when the soldiers were
afoot and making ready for the assault. Bourbon
placed himself at their head, clad all in white that
he might be better seen and known. To the walls
they advanced, bearing scaling ladders, which they
hastened to place. On the first raised of these
Bourbon set foot, with the soldier's desire to be the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
earliest in the assault. But hardly had he taken
two steps up the ladder than his grasp loosened
and he fell backward, with blood gushing from
his side. He had been hit with an arquebuse-shot
in the left side and mortally wounded.</p>

<p>He had but voice enough left to bid those near
him to cover his body with a cloak and take it away,
that his followers might not know of his death.
Those were the last words recorded of the Duke
of Bourbon. He died as he had lived, a valiant soldier
and a born adventurer, hurling havoc with his
last words on the great city of the Church; for his
followers, not knowing of his death, attacked so
furiously that the walls were soon carried and the
town theirs. Then, as news came to them that
their leader had fallen, they burst into the fury
of slaughter, shouting, "Slay, slay! blood, blood!
Bourbon! Bourbon!" and cutting down remorselessly
all whom they met.</p>

<p>The celebrated artist, Benvenuto Cellini, tells us
in his autobiography that it was he who shot Bourbon,
aiming his arquebuse from the wall of the
Campo Santo at one of the besiegers who was
mounted higher than the rest, and who, as he afterwards
learned, was the leader of the assailing army.</p>

<p>Whoever it was that fired the fatal shot, the slain
man was frightfully avenged, Rome being plundered,
ravaged, and devastated by his brutal followers
to a degree not surpassed by the work of the
Vandals of old. For several months the famous
city remained in the hands of this licentious soldiery,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and its inhabitants were subjected to every
outrage and barbarity which brutal desire and ungoverned
license could incite, while in none of its
former periods of ravage were so many of the
precious relics of antiquity destroyed as in this
period of occupation by men who called themselves
the soldiers of civilized and Christian lands.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-17" id="h2-17"></a><h2><i>ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY.</i></h2>

<p>"Kill! kill! kill!" was the cry in Paris.
"Blood! blood! death to the Huguenots!" came
from the lips of thousands of maddened murderers.
Blood flowed everywhere; men dabbled in blood,
almost bathed in blood. A crimson tide flowed in
the streets of Paris deep enough to damn the infamous
Catherine de' Medici and her confederates.
To the crime of assassination on that direful day of
St. Bartholomew must be added that of treachery
of the darkest hue. Peace had been made between
the warring parties. The Protestant chiefs had
been invited to Paris to witness the marriage of
the young King Henry of Navarre with Marguerite
de Valois, sister of the king of France, which was
fixed for the 18th of August, 1572. They had been
received with every show of amity and good-will.
The great Huguenot leader, Admiral de Coligny,
had come, confiding in the honor of his late foes,
and had been received by the king, Charles IX.,
with demonstrations of sincere friendship, though
the weak monarch warned him to beware of the
Guises, his bitter enemies and the remorseless haters
of all opponents of the Catholic party.</p>

<p>On the 22d of August the work of treachery began.
On that day a murderous shot was fired at
Coligny as he stood by the window of his room
engaged in reading a letter. It smashed two fingers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of his right hand, and lodged a ball in his left arm.
The would-be murderer escaped.</p>

<p>"Here is a fine proof of the fidelity to his agreement
of the Duke of Guise," said Coligny, reproachfully,
to the king.</p>

<p>"My dear father," returned the king, "the hurt
is yours, the grief and the outrage mine; but I will
take such vengeance that it shall never be forgotten."</p>

<p>He meant it for the moment; but his mind was
feeble, his will weak, himself a mere puppet in the
hands of his imperious mother and the implacable
Guises. Between them they had determined to rid
themselves of the opposing party in the state on the
death of the admiral and the other Protestant
leaders. Sure of their power over the king, the
orders for the massacre were already given when,
near midnight of August 24, St. Bartholomew's
day, the queen, with some of her leading councillors,
sought the king's room and made a determined
assault upon the feeble defences of his intellect.</p>

<p>"The slaughter of many thousands of men may
be prevented by a single sword-thrust," they argued.
"Only kill the admiral, the head and front of the
civil wars, and the strength of his party will die
with him. The sacrifice of two or three men will
satisfy the loyal party, who will remain forever
your faithful and obedient subjects. War is inevitable.
The Guises on one side, and the Huguenots
on the other, cannot be controlled. Better to win
a battle in Paris, where we hold all the chiefs in our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
clutches, than to put it to hazard in the field. In
this case pity would be cruelty, and cruelty would
be pity."</p>

<p>For an hour and a half the struggle with the
weak will of the king continued. He was violently
agitated, but could not bring himself to order the
murder of the guest to whom he had promised his
royal faith and protection. The queen mother
grew alarmed. Delay might ruin all, by the discovery
of her plans. At length, with a show of
indignation, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then, if you will not do this, permit me and
your brother to retire to some other part of the
kingdom."</p>

<p>This threat to leave him alone to grapple with the
difficulties that surrounded him frightened the
feeble king. He rose hastily from his seat.</p>

<p>"By God's death!" he cried, passionately,
"since you think proper to kill the admiral, I consent."
With these words he left the room.</p>

<p>The beginning of the work of bloodshed had been
fixed for an hour before daybreak. But the king
had spoken in a moment of passion and agitation.
An hour's reflection might change his mind. There
was no time to be lost. The queen gave the signal
at once, and out on the air of that dreadful night
rang the terrible tocsin peal from the tower of the
church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, the alarm call
for which the white-crossed murderers waited.</p>

<p>Quickly the silence of the night was broken by
loud cries, shouts of vengeance, the tramp of many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
feet, the sharp reports of musketry. The work was
begun. Every man not marked by a cross was
to be slaughtered. The voice of murder broke fearfully
upon the peacefulness of the recently quiet
midnight hour.</p>

<p>The noise roused Coligny. He rose hastily and
threw on his dressing-gown. The cries and shots
told him what was going on. He had trusted the
faithless Guises and the soulless De' Medici, and
this was what came of it.
</p>
<p>"M. Merlin," he said to a clergyman who was
with him, "say me a prayer; I commit my soul to
my Saviour."</p>

<p>Some of his gentlemen entered the room.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this riot?" asked
Ambrose Par&eacute;.</p>

<p>"My lord, it is God calling us," said Cornaton.</p>

<p>"I have long been ready to die," said the admiral;
"but you, my friends, save yourselves, if it is still
possible."</p>

<p>They left him, and escaped, the most of them by
the roof. Only one man stayed with him, Nicholas
Muss, a German servant, "as little concerned,"
says Cornaton, "as if there was nothing going on
around him."</p>

<p>The flight had been made barely in time. Hasty
footsteps were heard below. The assassins were in
the house. In a moment more the chamber door
was flung open and two servants of the Duke of
Guise entered.</p>

<p>"Art not thou the admiral?" asked one of them,
Behme by name.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Young man," answered Coligny, "thou comest
against a wounded and aged man. Thou'lt not
shorten my life by much."</p>

<p>Behme's answer was to plunge a heavy boar-spear
which he held into the body of the defenceless
veteran. Withdrawing it, he struck him on the
head with it. Coligny fell, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If it were but a man! But it is a horse-boy."</p>

<p>Others rushed into the room and thrust their
weapons into the dying man.</p>

<p>"Behme," cried the duke of Guise from the court-yard,
"hast thou done?"</p>

<p>"It is all over, my lord," answered the assassin.</p>

<p>The murderers flung the body from the window.
It fell with a crash at the feet of Guise and his companions.
They turned it over, wiped the blood from
the face, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Faith, it is he, sure enough!"</p>

<p>Some say that Guise kicked the bleeding corpse
in the face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, murder was everywhere. The savage
lower orders of Paris, all, high and low, of the party
of the Guises, were infected with the thirst for blood,
and the streets of the city became a horrible whirlpool
of slaughter, all who did not wear the saving
cross being shot down without mercy or discrimination.</p>

<p>The anecdotes of that fatal night and the succeeding
day are numerous, some of them pathetic,
most of them ferocious, all tending to show how
brutal man may become under the inspiration of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
religious prejudice and the example of slaughter,&mdash;the
blood fury, as it has been fitly termed.</p>

<p>T&eacute;ligny, the son-in-law of Coligny, took refuge
on a roof. The guards of the Duke of Anjou fired
at him as at a target. La Rochefoucauld, with
whom the king had been in merry chat until eleven
o'clock of the preceding evening, was aroused by
a loud knocking upon his door. He opened it; six
masked men rushed in, and instantly buried their
poniards in his body. The new queen of Navarre
had just gone to bed, under peremptory orders
from her mother, Catherine de' Medici. She was
wakened from her first slumber by a man knocking
and kicking at her door, with wild shouts of "Navarre!
Navarre!" Her nurse ran to open the
door, thinking that it was the king, her lady's
husband. A wounded and bleeding gentleman
rushed in, blood flowing from both arms, four
archers pursuing him into the queen's bedchamber.</p>

<p>The fugitive flung himself on the queen's couch,
seizing her in his alarm. She leaped out of bed
towards the wall, he following her, and still clasping
her round the body. What it meant she knew
not, but screamed in fright, her assailant screaming
as loudly. Their cries had the effect of bringing
into the room M. de Nan&ccedil;ay, captain of the guards,
who could not help laughing on seeing the plight
of the queen. But in an instant more he turned
in a rage upon the archers, cursed them for their
daring, and harshly bade them begone. As for the
fugitive, M. de Leran by name, he granted him his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
life at the queen's prayer. She put him to bed, in
her closet, and attended him until he was well of
his wounds.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the anecdotes told of that night
of terror. They might be extended indefinitely,
but anecdotes of murder are not of the most attractive
character, and may profitably be passed over.
The king saved some, including his nurse and
Ambrose Par&eacute; his surgeon, both Huguenots. Two
others, destined in the future to play the highest
parts in the kingdom, were saved by his orders.
These were the two Huguenot princes, Henry of
Navarre, and Henry de Cond&eacute;. The king sent for
them during the height of the massacre, and bade
them recant or die.</p>

<p>"I mean, for the future," he said, "to have but
one religion in my kingdom; the mass or death;
make your choice."</p>

<p>The king of Navarre asked for time to consider
the subject, reminding Charles of his promised
protection. Cond&eacute; was defiant.</p>

<p>"I will remain firm in what I believe to be the
true religion," he said, "though I have to give up
my life for it."</p>

<p>"Seditious madman, rebel, and son of a rebel,"
cried the king, furiously, "if within three days
you do not change your language, I will have you
strangled."</p>

<p>In three days Charles himself changed his language.
Remorse succeeded his insensate rage.</p>

<p>"Ambrose," he said to his surgeon, "I do not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
know what has come over me for the last two or
three days, but I feel my mind and body greatly
excited; in fact, just as if I had a fever. It seems
to me every moment, whether I wake or sleep, that
these murdered corpses appear to me with hideous
and blood-covered faces. I wish the helpless and
innocent had not been included."</p>

<p>On the next day he issued orders, prohibiting, on
pain of death, any slaying or plundering. But he
had raised a fury not easily to be allayed. The tocsin
of death still rang; to it the great bell of the
palace added at intervals its clanging peal; shouts,
yells, the sharp reports of pistols and arquebuses,
the shrieks of victims, filled the air; sixty thousand
murderers thronged the streets, slaying all who wore
not the white cross, breaking into and plundering
houses, and slaughtering all within them. All
through that dreadful Sunday the crimson carnival
went on, death everywhere, wagons loaded with
bleeding bodies traversing the streets, to cast their
gory burdens into the Seine, a scene of frightful
massacre prevailing such as city streets have seldom
witnessed. The king judged feebly if he deemed
that with a word he could quell the storm his voice
had raised. Many of the nobles of the court, satisfied
with the death of the Huguenot leaders,
attempted to stay the work of death, but a report
that a party of Huguenots had attempted to kill
the king added to the popular fury, and the sanguinary
work went on.</p>

<p>It is not known how many were slain during that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
outbreak of slaughter. It was not confined to
Paris, but spread through France. Thousands are
said to have been killed in the city. In the kingdom
the number slain has been variously estimated
at from ten to one hundred thousand. Such was
the frightful result of a lamentable event in which
religious animosity was taken advantage of to intensify
the political enmity of the warring parties of
the realm.</p>

<p>It proved a useless infamy. Charles IX. died
two years afterwards, after having suffered agonies
of remorse. Despite the massacre, the Huguenots
were not all slain. Nor had the murder of Coligny
robbed them of a leader. Henry of Navarre, who
had narrowly escaped death on that fearful night,
was in the coming years to lead the Protestants to
many a victory, and in the end to become king of
France, as Henry IV. By his coronation, Coligny
was revenged; the Huguenots, instead of being exterminated
by the hand of massacre, had defeated
their foes and raised their leader to the throne,
and the Edict of Nantes, which was soon afterwards
announced, gave liberty of conscience to
France for many years thereafter.

<p><br /></p>
<a name="h2-18" id="h2-18"></a><h2><i>KING HENRY OF NAVARRE.</i></h2>

<p>For the first time in its history France had a
Protestant king. Henry III. had died by the knife
of an assassin. Henry of Navarre was named by
him as his successor. But the Catholic chiefs of
France, in particular the leaders of the League
which had been banded against Henry III., were
bitterly opposed to the reign of a Huguenot in a
realm that had always been governed by Catholic
kings, and it was evident that only by the sword
could the throne be secured.</p>

<p>The League held Paris and much of France.
Henry's army was too weak to face them. He fell
back on Dieppe, that he might be near the coast,
and in position to receive reinforcements and supplies
promised him by Queen Elizabeth. The Duke
of Mayenne pursued him with an army of some
thirty-five thousand men. Such was the situation
at the date of the opening of our story.</p>

<p>Henry III. had been killed on the 1st of August,
1589. Henry IV. was proclaimed king on the 2d
of August. On the 26th of the same month he
reached Dieppe, where he was met by the governor,
Aymar de Chastes, and the leading citizens, who
brought him the keys of the place.</p>

<p>"I come to salute my lord and hand over to him
the government of this city," said Aymar, who was
a Catholic noble.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ventre-saint-gris!" cried Henry, with his favorite
exclamation; "I know none more worthy
of it than you are."</p>

<p>The citizens crowded round the king, profuse in
their expressions of loyalty.</p>

<p>"No fuss, my lads," said Henry, who was the
embodiment of plain common sense; "all I want
is your affection, good bread, good wine, and good
hospitable faces."</p>

<p>Within the town he was received with loud cheers,
and the population seemed enthusiastic in his favor.
But the shrewd soldier had no idea of shutting himself
up in a walled town, to be besieged there by
Mayenne. So, after carefully inspecting its fortifications,
he left five hundred men within the town,
assisted by a garrison of burgesses, and established
his camp on a neighboring hill, crowned by the old
castle of Arques, where he put all his men and all
the peasants that could be found busily to work digging
like beavers, working night and day to fortify
the camp. He set the example himself in the use
of the spade.</p>

<p>"It is a wonder I am alive with such work as I
have," he wrote at the time. "God have pity upon
me and show me mercy, blessing my labors, as He
does in spite of many folks. I am well, and my
affairs are going well. I have taken Eu. The
enemy, who are double me just now, thought to
catch me there; but I drew off towards Dieppe, and
I await them in a camp that I am fortifying. To-morrow
will be the day when I shall see them, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
I hope, with God's help, that if they attack me
they will find they have made a bad bargain."</p>

<p>The enemy came, as Henry had said, saw his
preparations, and by a skilful man&oelig;uvre sought to
render them useless. Mayenne had no fancy for
attacking those strong works in front. He managed,
by an unlooked-for movement, to push himself
between the camp and the town, "hoping to cut
off the king's communications with the sea, divide
his forces, deprive him of his reinforcements from
England, and, finally, surround him and capture
him, as he had promised the Leaguers of Paris, who
were already talking of the iron cage in which the
Bearnese would be sent to them."</p>

<p>But Henry IV. was not the man to be caught
easily in a trap. Much as had been his labor at
digging, he at once changed his plans, and decided
that it would not pay him to await the foe in his intrenchments.
If they would not come to him, he
must go to them, preserving his communications at
any cost. Chance, rather than design, brought the
two armies into contact. A body of light-horse
approached the king's intrenchments. A sharp
skirmish followed.</p>

<p>"My son," said Marshal de Biron to the young
Count of Auvergne, "charge; now is the time."</p>

<p>The young soldier&mdash;a prince by birth&mdash;obeyed,
and so effectively that he put the Leaguers to rout,
killed three hundred of them, and returned to camp
unobstructed. On the succeeding two days similar
encounters took place, with like good fortune for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Henry's army. Mayenne was annoyed. His prestige
was in danger of being lost. He determined
to recover it by attacking the intrenchments of the
king with his whole army.</p>

<p>The night of the 20th of September came. It
was a very dark one. Henry, having reason to
expect an attack, kept awake the whole night. In
company with a group of his officers, he gazed over
the dark valley within which lay Mayenne's army.
The silence was profound. Afar off could be seen
a long line of lights, so flickering and inconstant
that the observers were puzzled to decide if they
were men or glow-worms.</p>

<p>At five in the morning, Henry gave orders that
every man should be at his post. He had his breakfast
brought to him on the field, and ate it with a
hearty appetite, seated in a fosse with his officers
around him. While there a prisoner was brought
in who had been taken during a reconnoissance.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Belin," said the king, who knew
him. "Embrace me for your welcome appearance."</p>

<p>Belin did so, taking the situation philosophically.</p>

<p>"To give you appetite for dinner," he said, "you
are about to have work to do with thirty thousand
foot and ten thousand horse. Where are your
forces?" he continued, looking around curiously.</p>

<p>"You don't see them all, M. de Belin," answered
Henry. "You don't reckon the good God and the
good right, but they are ever with me."</p>

<p>Belin had told the truth. About ten o'clock Mayenne
made his attack. It was a day ill-suited for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
battle, for there lay upon the field so thick a fog that
the advancing lines could not see each other at ten
paces apart. Despite this, the battle proceeded
briskly, and for nearly three hours the two armies
struggled, now one, now the other, in the ascendant.</p>

<p>Henry fought as vigorously as any of his men,
all being so confusedly mingled in the fog that
there was little distinction between officers and soldiers.
At one time he found himself so entangled
in a medley of disorganized troopers that he loudly
shouted,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Courage, gentlemen; pray, courage! Are there
not among you fifty gentlemen willing to die with
their king?"</p>

<p>The confusion was somewhat alleviated by the
arrival, at this juncture, of five hundred men from
Dieppe, whose opportune coming the king gladly
greeted. Springing from his horse, he placed himself
beside Chatillon, their leader, to fight in the
trenches. The battle, which had been hot at this
point, now grew furious, and for some fifteen minutes
there was a hand-to-hand struggle in the fog,
like that of two armies fighting in the dead of night.</p>

<p>Then came a welcome change. For what followed
we may quote Sully. "When things were in
this desperate state," he says, "the fog, which had
been very thick all the morning, dropped down suddenly,
and the cannon of the castle of Arques,
getting sight of the enemy's army, a volley of four
pieces was fired, which made four beautiful lanes in
their squadrons and battalions. That pulled them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
up quite short; and three or four volleys in succession,
which produced marvellous effects, made
them waver, and, little by little, retire all of them
behind the turn of the valley, out of cannon-shot,
and finally to their quarters."</p>

<p>Mayenne was defeated. The king held the field.
He pursued the enemy for some distance, and then
returned to Arques to return thanks to God for the
victory. Immediately afterwards, Mayenne struck
camp and marched away, leaving Henry master of
the situation. The king of Navarre had scored a
master-point in the contest for the throne of France.</p>

<p>During the ensuing year the cause of the king
rapidly advanced. More and more of France
acknowledged him as the legitimate heir to the
throne. A year after the affair at Dieppe he
marched suddenly and rapidly on Paris, and would
have taken it had not Mayenne succeeded in throwing
his army into the city when it was half captured.
In March, 1590, the two armies met again on the
plain of Ivry, a village half-way between Mantes
and Dreux, and here was fought one of the famous
battles of history, a conflict whose final result was
to make Henry IV. king of all France.</p>

<p>On this notable field the king was greatly outnumbered.
Mayenne had under his command about
four thousand horse and twenty thousand foot,
while Henry's force consisted of three thousand
horse and eight thousand foot. But the king's
men were much better disciplined, and much more
largely moved by patriotism, Mayenne's army being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
in considerable part made up of German and Swiss
auxiliaries. The king's men, Catholics and
Protestants alike, were stirred by a strong religious
enthusiasm. In a grave and earnest speech
to his men, Henry placed the issue of the day in
the hands of the Almighty. The Catholics of his
army crowded to the neighboring churches to hear
mass. The Huguenots, much fewer in number,
"also made their prayers after their sort."</p>

<p>The day of battle dawned,&mdash;March 14, 1590.
Henry's army was drawn up with the infantry to
right and left,&mdash;partly made up of German and
Swiss auxiliaries,&mdash;the cavalry, under his own command,
in the centre. In this arm, in those days
of transition between ancient and modern war, the
strength of armies lay, and those five lines of horsemen
were that day to decide the fate of the field.</p>

<p>In the early morning Henry displayed a winning
instance of that generous good feeling for which he
was noted. Count Schomberg, colonel of the German
auxiliaries, had, some days before, asked for
the pay of his troops, saying that they would not
fight if not paid. Henry, indignant at this implied
threat, had harshly replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"People do not ask for money on the eve of a
battle."</p>

<p>He now, just as the battle was about to begin,
approached Schomberg with a look of contrition on
his face.</p>

<p>"Colonel," he said, "I have hurt your feelings.
This may be the last day of my life. I cannot bear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to take away the honor of a brave and honest gentleman
like you. Pray forgive me and embrace
me."</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Schomberg, with deep feeling,
"the other day your Majesty wounded me; to-day
you kill me."</p>

<p>He gave up the command of the German reiters
that he might fight in the king's own squadron, and
was killed in the battle.</p>

<p>As the two armies stood face to face, waiting for
the signal of onset, Henry rode along the front of
his squadron, and halted opposite their centre.</p>

<p>"Fellow-soldiers," he said, "you are Frenchmen;
behold the enemy! If to-day you run my risks, I
also run yours. I will conquer or die with you.
Keep your ranks well, I pray you. If the heat of
battle disperse you for a while, rally as soon as you
can under those pear-trees you see up yonder to
my right; and if you lose sight of your standards,
do not lose sight of my white plume. Make that
your rallying point, for you will always find it in
the path of honor, and, I hope, of victory also."</p>

<p>And Henry pointed significantly to the snow-white
plume that ornamented his helmet, while a
shout of enthusiastic applause broke from all those
who had heard his stirring appeal. Those words
have become famous. The white plume of Henry
of Navarre is still one of the rallying points of history.
It has also a notable place in poetry, in
Macaulay's stirring ode of "Ivry," from which we
quote:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-4">"'And if my standard-bearer fall,<br /></span>
<span>As fall full well he may;<br /></span>
<span>For never saw I promise yet<br /></span>
<span>Of such a bloody fray;<br /></span>
<span>Press where ye see my white plume shine<br /></span>
<span>Amidst the ranks of war,<br /></span>
<span>And be your oriflamme to-day<br /></span>
<span>The helmet of Navarre.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The words we have quoted spoken, Henry galloped
along the whole line of his army; then halted
again, threw his bridle over his arm, and said, with
clasped hands and deep feeling,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O God, Thou knowest my thoughts, and dost
see to the very bottom of my heart; if it be for my
people's good that I keep the crown, favor Thou my
cause and uphold my arms. But if Thy holy will
have otherwise ordained, at least let me die, O God,
in the midst of these brave soldiers who give their
lives for me!"</p>

<p>The infantry began the battle. Egmont, in command
of Mayenne's right wing, attacked sharply,
but after a brief success was killed and his men
repulsed. On the king's right, Aumont, Biron, and
Montpensier drove their opponents before them. At
this stage of the affray Mayenne, in command of
the powerful body of cavalry in the centre, fell
upon the king's horse with a furious charge, which
for the time threatened to carry all before it. The
lines wavered and broke; knights and nobles fell
back; confusion began and was increasing; the
odds appeared too great; for a brief and perilous
period the battle seemed lost.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>At this critical moment Henry came to the rescue.
Victory or death had been his word to his men.
His promise was now to be kept in deeds. Pointing
with his sword to the enemy, and calling in a loud
voice upon all who heard him to follow, he spurred
fiercely forward, and in a moment his white plume
was seen waving in the thickest ranks of the foe.</p>

<p>His cry had touched the right place in the hearts
of his followers. Forgetting every thought but
that of victory and the rescue of their beloved
leader, they pushed after him in a gallant and
irresistible charge, which resembled in its impetuosity
that of the Black Prince at Poitiers. Mayenne's
thronging horsemen wavered and broke
before this impetuous rush. Into the heart of the
opposing army rode Henry and his ardent followers,
cutting, slashing, shouting in victorious enthusiasm.
In a few minutes the forward movement of
Mayenne's cavalry was checked. His troops halted,
wavered, broke, and fled, hotly pursued by their
foes. The battle was won. That rush of the white
plume had carried all before it, and swept the
serried ranks of the Leaguers to the winds. Let us
quote the poetic rendition of this scene from
Macaulay's ode.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-4">"Hurrah! the foes are moving!<br /></span>
<span>Hark to the mingled din<br /></span>
<span>Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum<br /></span>
<span>And roaring culverin!<br /></span>
<span>The fiery duke is pricking fast<br /></span>
<span>Across St Andr&eacute;'s plain,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a><br /></span>
<span>With all the hireling cavalry<br /></span>
<span>Of Gueldres and Almayne.<br /></span>
<span>'Now by the lips of those ye love,<br /></span>
<span>Fair gentlemen of France,<br /></span>
<span>Charge for the golden lilies,<br /></span>
<span>Upon them with the lance!'<br /></span>
<span>A thousand spurs are striking deep,<br /></span>
<span>A thousand spears in rest,<br /></span>
<span>A thousand knights are pressing close<br /></span>
<span>Behind a snow-white crest,<br /></span>
<span>And in they burst, and on they rushed,<br /></span>
<span>While, like a gliding star,<br /></span>
<span>Amidst the thickest carnage blazed<br /></span>
<span>The helmet of Navarre."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The enemy's cavalry being in flight and hotly
pursued, Henry with a handful of horsemen (he
had but thirty at his back when he came out of
the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e) charged upon the Walloons and Swiss,
who instantly broke and fled, with such impetuous
haste that they left their standards behind them.</p>

<p>"Slay the strangers, but spare the French," was
the king's order, as a hot pursuit of the flying infantry
began, in which the German auxiliaries in particular
were cut down mercilessly.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-4">"And then we thought on vengeance,<br /></span>
<span>And all along our van,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>The Swiss, however, ancient friends and allies of
France, begged the king's compassion and were
admitted to mercy, being drafted into his service.
The flying Germans and French were severely punished,
great numbers of them falling, many more
being taken, the list of prisoners including a large
number of lords and leaders of the foe. The battle
had been remarkably short. It was won by the
cavalry, the infantry having scarcely come into
action. As to its effect, we may quote again from
the poem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-4">"Now glory to the Lord of Hosts,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It "turned the chance of war" in truth, in
a great measure. Paris was in consternation.
Everywhere was a great change in public opinion.
Men ceased to look on Henry as an adventurous
soldier, and came to regard him as a great prince,
fighting for his own. Beyond this, however, the
effect was not immediate. Paris remained in the
hands of the League. A Spanish League was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
formed. The difficulties seemed to grow deeper.
The only easy solution to them was an abjuration
of the Protestant faith, and to this view Henry
in the end came. He professed conversion to
Catholicism, and all opposition ceased. Henry IV.
became the fully acknowledged king of France, and
for the time being all persecution of the Huguenots
was at an end.

<a name="h2-19" id="h2-19"></a><h2><i>THE MURDER OF A KING.</i></h2>

<p>History is full of stories of presentiments, of
"visions of sudden death," made notable by their
realization, of strange disasters predicted in advance.
Doubtless there have been very many presentiments
that failed to come true, enough, possibly, to make
those that have been realized mere coincidences.
However that be, these agreements of prediction
and event are, to say the least, curious. The case
of C&aelig;sar is well known. We have now to relate
that of Henry IV.</p>

<p>Sully has told the story. Henry had married, as
a second wife, Mary de' Medici, daughter of the
Grand Duke of Tuscany, and a woman whose headstrong
temper and cantankerous disposition were by
no means calculated to make his life with her an
agreeable one. In the end she strongly insisted on
being crowned queen, a desire on her part which
was very unpleasant to her royal husband, who
seemed to feel that some disaster impended over the
event.</p>

<p>"Hey! my friend," he said to Sully, his intimate,
"I know not what is the meaning of it, but my
heart tells me that some misfortune will happen to
me."</p>

<p>He was seated on a low chair, his face disturbed
by uneasy thought, his fingers drumming on his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
spectacle-case. Of a sudden he sprang up, and
struck his hand sharply on his thigh.</p>

<p>"By God!" he said; "I shall die in this city,
and shall never go out of it. They will kill me. I
see quite well that they have no other remedy in
their dangers but my death. Ah! accursed coronation;
thou wilt be the cause of my death!"</p>

<p>"What fancy is this of yours?" asked Sully.
"If it continue, I am of opinion that you should
break off this anointment and coronation. If you
please to give me orders, it shall be done."</p>

<p>"Yes, break off the coronation," said the king.
"Let me hear no more about it. I shall have my
mind at rest from divers fancies which certain warnings
have put into it. To hide nothing from you,
I have been told that I was to be killed at the first
grand ceremony I should undertake, and that I
should die in a carriage."</p>

<p>"You never told me that, sir," answered Sully.
"I have often been astounded to hear you cry out
when in a carriage, as if you had dreaded this petty
peril, after having so many times seen you amidst
cannon-balls, musketry, lance-thrusts, pike-thrusts,
and sword-thrusts, without being a bit afraid. Since
your mind is so exercised thereby, if I were you,
I would go away to-morrow, let the coronation
take place without you, or put it off to another time,
and not enter Paris for a long time, or in a carriage.
If you please, I will send word to Notre Dame and
St. Denys to stop everything and to withdraw the
workmen."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very much inclined," said the king; "but
what will my wife say? She has gotten this coronation
marvellously into her head."</p>

<p>"She may say what she likes," rejoined Sully.
"But I cannot think that, when she knows your
opinion about it, she will persist any longer."</p>

<p>He did not know Mary de' Medici. She did persist
strongly and offensively. For three days the
matter was disputed, with high words on both sides.
In the end, Henry, weary of the contention, and
finding it impossible to convince or silence his obstinate
wife, gave way, and the laborers were again
set to work to prepare for the coronation.</p>

<p>Despite his presentiments Henry remained in
Paris, and gave orders for the immediate performance
of the ceremony, as if he were anxious to have
done with it, and to pass the crisis in his life which
he feared. The coronation was proclaimed on the
12th of May, 1610. It took place on the 13th, at
St. Denys. The tragical event which he had
dreaded did not take place. He breathed easier.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 14th, he took it in mind to
go to the arsenal to see Sully, who was ill. Yet the
same indecision and fear seemed to possess him.
He stirred about in an unquiet and irresolute mood,
saying several times to the queen, "My dear, shall
I go or not?"</p>

<p>He went so far as to leave the room two or three
times, but each time returned, in the same doubt.</p>

<p>"My dear, shall I really go?" he said to the
queen; and then, making up his mind, he kissed her
several times and bade her adieu.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p212" id="p212"></a>
<img src="images/p212.jpg" alt="CHAMBER OF MARY DE&#39; MEDICI." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">CHAMBER OF MARY DE&#39; MEDICI.</span></div>

<p>"I shall only go there and back," he said; "I
shall be here again almost directly."</p>

<p>On reaching his carriage, M. de Praslin, the captain
of his guard, proposed to attend him, but he
would not permit it, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get you gone; I want nobody; go about your
business."</p>

<p>Yet that morning, in a conversation with Guise
and Bassompierre, he had spoken as if he dreaded
quickly coming death.</p>

<p>"You will live, please God, long years yet," said
Bassompierre. "You are only in the flower of your
age, in perfect bodily health and strength, full of
honor more than any mortal man, in the most
flourishing kingdom in the world, loved and adored
by your subjects, with fine houses, fine women, fine
children who are growing up."</p>

<p>Henry sighed, as if still oppressed by his presentiments,
and sadly answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friend, all that must be left."</p>

<p>Those were his last words of which any record
remains, save the few he spoke in the carriage. A
few hours afterwards all the earthly blessings of
which Bassompierre spoke were naught to him.
The king was dead.</p>

<p>To return to our subject; in the carriage with
the king were several gentlemen of the court.
Henry occupied the rear seat at the left, with M.
d'Epernon seated at his right, and M. de Montbazon
between him and the door, while several other gentlemen
occupied the remaining seats. When the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
carriage reached the Croix du Tiroir, the coachman
asked whither he should drive, and was bidden to go
towards St. Innocent. On the way thither, while
in the Rue de la Ferronnerie, a cart obstructed the
way, so that the carriage had to turn towards the
sidewalk and to proceed more slowly. Here were
some ironmongers' shops, beside one of which
lurked a man, his eyes keenly fixed on the approaching
carriage, his hand nervously clutching some
object in his pocket.</p>

<p>As the carriage moved slowly by, this man sprang
from his covert and rushed towards it, a knife in
his hand. In an instant he had dealt the king two
blows, in rapid succession, in the left side. The
first struck him below the armpit and went upward,
merely grazing the flesh. The other proved more
dangerous. It entered his side between the fifth
and sixth ribs, and, taking a downward direction,
cut a large blood-vessel. The king, by chance, had
his left hand on the shoulder of M. de Montbazon,
and was leaning towards M. d'Epernon, to whom he
was speaking. He thus laid himself more fully
open to the assassin's knife.</p>

<p>All had passed so quickly that no movement of
defence was possible. Henry gave a low cry and
made a few movements.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, sir?" asked M. de Montbazon,
who had not seen the affair.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," answered the king. "It is
nothing," he repeated, his voice now so low that
they could barely hear him. Those were the last
words he spoke.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>The assassin had been seized. He was a fanatic,
named Fran&ccedil;ois Ravaillac, who had been roused to
his mad act by rumors that Henry intended to make
war upon the pope, and other baseless fancies of the
king's opponents. With him we are not further
concerned, other than to say that he was made to
suffer the most barbarous tortures for his deed.</p>

<p>The carriage was turned and driven back to the
Louvre. On reaching the entrance steps some wine
was given to the wounded monarch. An officer of
the guard raised his head, his only sign of intelligence
being some movements of the eyes. In a
moment more they were closed, never to be opened
again.</p>

<p>He was carried up-stairs and laid on the couch in
his closet, and from there taken to the bed in his
chamber. As he lay there some one gave him holy
water, and M. de Vic, a councillor of state, put to
his mouth the cross of his order, and directed his
thoughts to God. All this was lost on the king.
He lay motionless and insensible. All around him
were in tears. The grief of the queen was unconsolable.
All Paris was weeping. The monarch
against whom the Parisians had so bitterly fought
they now mourned as they would have done for their
dearest friend.</p>

<p>The surgeons wanted to dress the king's wounds.
Milon, the chief physician, who sat weeping at the
bedside, waved them aside. A faint sigh died
away on the king's lips. "It is all over," said
Milon, sadly. "He is gone."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>What followed may be told in a few words. The
old adage, "The king is dead; long live the king!"
was the thought of practical men of affairs. Sully,
whom the news of the assassination had raised in
haste from his sick-bed, put himself quickly at the
head of some forty horse and rode towards the palace.
Guise and Bassompierre had come to the door,
to see what was passing outside, as he rode up.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said to them, with tearful eyes,
"if the service you vowed to the king be impressed
upon your souls as deeply as it ought to be with all
good Frenchmen, swear this moment to keep
towards the king's son and heir the same allegiance
that you showed him, and to spend your lives and
your blood in avenging his death."</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Bassompierre, "it is for us to
cause this oath to be taken by others; we have no
need to be exhorted thereto."</p>

<p>Leaving them, Sully rode to the Bastille, which
he took possession of, and sent out soldiers to seize
and carry off all the bread that could be found in
the market and at the shops of the bakers. He
despatched a messenger also, in the greatest haste,
to his son-in-law, M. de Rohan, then in command
of a force of six thousand Swiss, bidding him to
march with all speed upon Paris.</p>

<p>Henry IV. was dead. His son was his legitimate
successor. But the murder of Henry III. had been
followed by a contest for the throne. That of
Henry IV. might be. Sully felt it necessary to take
precautions, although the king was hardly cold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
in death. The king dies; the kingship survives;
prudent men, on whom the peace of a people depend,
prepare without delay; the Duke de Sully
was such a man. His precautions, however, were
not needed. No one thought of opposing the heirship
of the king's son.

<br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-20" id="h2-20"></a><h2><i>RICHELIEU AND THE
CONSPIRATORS.</i></h2>

<p>In a richly-furnished state apartment of the royal
palace of the Luxembourg, on a day in November,
1630, stood Louis XIII., king of France, tapping
nervously with his fingers on the window-pane, and
with a disturbed and irresolute look upon his face.
Beside him was his favorite, St. Simon, a showily-dressed
and handsome gentleman of the court.</p>

<p>"What do you think of all this?" asked the
king, his fingers keeping up their idle drumming on
the glass.</p>

<p>"Sir, I seem to be in another world," was the
politic reply. "But at any rate you are master."</p>

<p>"I am," said the king, proudly, "and I will make
it felt, too."</p>

<p>The royal prisoner was stirring uneasily in the
bonds which hard necessity had cast round his will.
It was against Cardinal Richelieu that his testy
remark was made, yet in the very speaking he could
not but feel that to lose Richelieu was to lose the
bulwark of his throne; that this imperious master,
against whose rule he chafed, was the glory and the
support of his reign.</p>

<p>Just now, however, the relations between king
and cardinal were sadly strained. Mary de' Medici,
the king's mother, once Richelieu's ardent friend,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
was now his active foe. The queen, Anne of Austria,
was equally hostile. Their influence had been
used to its utmost to poison the mind of the monarch
against his minister, and seemingly with success.
To all appearance it looked as if the great
cardinal was near his fall.</p>

<p>Rumor of what was afloat had invaded the court.
Everywhere were secret whisperings, knowing looks,
expectant movements. The courtiers were flocking
to the Luxembourg, in hopes of some advantage to
themselves. Marillac, the keeper of the seals, was
at his country house at Glatigny, very near Versailles,
where the king was expected. He remained
there in hopes that Louis would send for him and
put the power of the disgraced cardinal into his
hands. The colossus seemed about to fall. All
waited expectantly.</p>

<p>The conspiracy of the queen-mother had gone
farther than to use her personal influence with her
son against the cardinal. There were others in
league with her, particularly Marillac, the keeper
of the seals, and Marshal Marillac, his brother,
then in command of a large force in Piedmont.
All had been carefully prepared against the fall of
the minister. The astute conspirators had fully
laid their plans as to what was to follow.</p>

Unfortunately for them, they did not reckon
with the two principal parties concerned, Louis
XIII. and Cardinal Richelieu. With all his weaknesses
of temper and mind, the king had intellect
enough to know what were the great interests of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
kingdom and power, and on whose shoulders they
rested. Above all the littleness of a court cabal
he could not but discern the great questions which
impended, and with which he felt quite incompetent
to deal. And he could perceive but one man in
his kingdom able to handle these great problems
of state.

<p>As for Richelieu, he was by no means blind to
what was going on around him. He was the last
man in the world to be a dupe. Delaying until the
time seemed ripe to move, he requested and obtained
an interview with the king. They were a long time
closeted, while all the courtier-world of Paris waited
in expectation and suspense.</p>

<p>What passed in that private cabinet of the palace
no one knew, but when the interview was over it
quickly became evident that the queen-mother and
her associates had lost, the cardinal had won.
Michael de Marillac had hopeful dreams that night,
as he slept in his house at Glatigny; but when he
awoke in the morning it was to receive the disturbing
news that the king and the cardinal were at
Versailles together, the minister being lodged in a
room under that of the monarch. Quickly came
still more disturbing news. The king demanded
a return of the seals. Before this tidings could be
well digested, the frightened plotter learned that
his own arrest had been ordered, and that the exons
were already at his door to secure his person.</p>

<p>While the courtier conspirator was being thus
attended to, the soldier, his brother, was not forgotten.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
A courier had been despatched to the headquarters
of the army in Piedmont, bearing a letter
to Marshal Schomberg, who, with Marshals La
Force and Marillac, had formed there a junction
of the forces under their control. Marillac was in
command on the day of the courier's arrival, and
was impatiently awaiting the news, for which he
had been prepared by his brother, of the cardinal's
disgrace.</p>

<p>Schomberg opened his despatches. The first
words he saw, in the king's own handwriting, were
these:
</p>
<p>"My dear cousin, you will not fail to arrest Marshal
Marillac; it is for the good of my service and
for your own exculpation."</p>

<p>Schomberg looked at the document with startled
eyes. What could this mean? And was it safe to
attempt an arrest? A large section of the troops
were devoted to Marillac. He consulted with La
Force, who advised him to obey orders, whatever
the consequences. Schomberg thereupon showed
Marillac the despatch. He beheld it with surprise
and alarm, but without thought of resistance.</p>

<p>"I can protest that I have done nothing contrary
to the king's service," he said. "The truth is, that
my brother, the keeper of the seals, and I have
always been the servants of the queen-mother. She
must have had the worst of it, and Cardinal Richelieu
has won the day against her and her servants."</p>

So it proved, indeed, and he was to suffer for it.
He was tried,&mdash;not on any political charge, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the crimes alleged against him were peculation
and extortion, common practices with many of his
fellow-generals.

<p>"It is a very strange thing," said he, bitterly, "to
prosecute me as they do; my trial is a mere question
of hay, straw, wood, stones, and lime; there
is not case enough for whipping a lackey."</p>

<p>He was mistaken; there was case enough for
beheading a marshal. It was not a question of
peculation, but of offending the great cardinal, for
which he was really put on trial, and the case ended
in his being found guilty of malfeasance in office
and executed. His brother died in prison three
months afterwards,&mdash;of decline, so the records say.</p>

<p>"Dupes' Day," as the day we have described came
to be called, was over. The queen-mother had lost.
Her dupes had suffered. Richelieu was more powerful
than ever. She had but strengthened his
ascendancy over the king. But Mary de' Medici
was not the woman to acknowledge defeat easily.
No sooner had her first effort failed than her enmity
against the too-powerful minister showed itself in
a new direction, the principal agent of her purposes
being now her son, the Duke of Orleans, brother to
the king. The duke, after an angry interview with
the cardinal, left Paris in haste for Orleans, his
mother declaring to the king that the occasion of
his sudden departure was that he could no longer
tolerate by his presence Richelieu's violent proceedings
against herself. She professed to have been
taken by surprise by his departure, which Louis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
doubting, "she took occasion to belch forth fire
and flames against the cardinal, and made a fresh
attempt to ruin him in the king's estimation, though
she had previously bound herself by oath to take
no more steps against him."</p>

<p>Her malignity defeated itself. Richelieu was too
skilful an adept in the game of politics to be so
easily beaten. He brought the affair before the
council, seemingly utterly indifferent what might
be done; the trouble might be ended, he suggested,
by his own retirement or that of the queen-mother,
whichever in their wisdom they might deem best.</p>

<p>The implied threat settled the matter. The king,
alarmed at the idea of having the government of
France left on his weak hands, at once gave the
offending lady to understand that she had better
retire for a time to one of his provincial palaces,
recommending Moulins. Mary de' Medici heard
this order with fiery indignation. She shut herself
up in the castle of Compi&egrave;gne, where she then was,
and declared that she would not leave unless
dragged out by main force. In the end, however,
she changed her mind, fled by night from the castle,
and made her way to Brussels, where she took refuge
from her powerful foe. Richelieu's game was won.
Mary de' Medici had lost all influence with her son.
She was never to see him again.</p>

<p>A number of years passed before a new plot was
hatched against the cardinal. Then a conspiracy
was organized which threatened not only his power
but his life. It was in 1636. The king's headquarters
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
were then at the castle of Demuin. The
Duke of Orleans, who had been recently in armed
rebellion against the king, and had been pardoned
for his treason, determined, in common with the
Count of Soissons, that their enemy, the cardinal,
should die. There were others in this plot of assassination,
two of the duke's gentlemen, Montr&eacute;sor
and Saint Ibal, being chosen to deal the fatal blow.
They were to station themselves at the foot of the
grand stairway, meet Richelieu at his exit from the
council, and strike him dead. The duke was to give
the signal for the murderous assault.</p>

<p>The door of the council chamber opened. The
king and the cardinal came out together and descended
the stairs in company, Richelieu attending
Louis until he had reached the foot of the stairway,
and gone into an adjoining room. The cardinal
turned to ascend again, without a moment's
suspicion that the two gentlemen at the stair-foot
clutched hidden daggers in their hands, ready, at
a signal from the duke, who stood near by, to
plunge them in his breast.</p>

<p>The signal did not come. At the last moment
the courage of Gaston of Orleans failed him.
Whether from something in Richelieu's earnest and
dignified aspect, or some sudden fear of serious
consequences to himself, the chief conspirator turned
hastily away, without speaking the fatal word
agreed upon. What the duke feared to do, the
count dared not do. The two chosen assassins
stood expectant, greeting the cardinal as he passed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and waiting in nervous impatience for the promised
signal. It failed to come. Their daggers
remained undrawn. Richelieu calmly ascended the
stairs to his rooms, without a dream of the deadly
peril he had run.</p>

<p>The conspiracy against the cardinal which has
attained the greatest historical notoriety is that
associated with the name of Cinq-Mars, the famous
favorite of Louis XIII. Brilliant and witty, a
true type of the courtiers of the time, this handsome
youth so amused and interested the king that,
when he was only nineteen years of age, Louis made
him master of the wardrobe and grand equerry of
France. M. Le Grand he was called, and grand
enough he seemed, in his independent and capricious
dealings with the king. Louis went so far
as to complain to Richelieu of the humors of his
youthful favorite.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," he wrote, under date of
January 4, 1641, "to trouble you about the ill-tempers
of M. Le Grand. I upbraided him with
his heedlessness; he answered that for that matter
he could not change, and that he should do no
better than he had done. I said that, considering
his obligations to me, he ought not to address me
in that manner. He answered in his usual way;
that he didn't want my kindness, that he could do
very well without it, and that he would be quite
as well content to be Cinq-Mars as M. Le Grand,
but as for changing his ways and his life, he
couldn't do it. And so, he continually nagging at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
me and I at him, we came as far as the court-yard,
where I said to him that, being in the temper he
was in, he would do me the pleasure of not coming
to see me. I have not seen him since."</p>

<p>This letter yields a curious revelation of the secret
history of a royal court. There have been few kings
with whom such impudent independence would
have served. Louis XIII. was one of them. Cinq-Mars
seems to have known his man. The quarrel
was not of long continuance. Richelieu, who had
first placed the youth near the king, easily reconciled
them, a service which the foolish boy soon
repaid by lending an ear to the enemies of the cardinal.
For this Richelieu was in a way responsible.
He had begun to find the constant attendance of
the favorite upon the king troublesome to himself,
and gave him plainly to understand so. "One day
he sent word to him not to be for the future so continually
at his heels, and treated him even to his
face with as much tartness and imperiousnesss as
if he had been the lowest of his valets." Such
treatment was not likely to be well received by one
of the independent disposition of Cinq-Mars. He
joined in a plot against the cardinal.</p>

<p>The king was ill; the cardinal more so. Gaston,
Duke of Orleans, was again in Paris, and full of his
old intriguing spirit. The Duke of Bouillon was
there also, having been sent for by the king to take
command of the army of Italy. He, too, was drawn
into the plot which was being woven against Richelieu.
The queen, Anne of Austria, was another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of the conspirators. The plot thus organized was
the deepest and most far-reaching which had yet
been laid against the all-powerful minister.</p>

<p>Bouillon was prince-sovereign of the town of
Sedan. This place was to serve the conspirators as
an asylum in case of reverse. But a town was not
enough; an army was needed; whence should it
come? Spain might furnish it.</p>

<p>The affair was growing to the dimensions of a
conspiracy against the crown as well as the minister.
Viscount de Fontrailles, a man who detested the
cardinal, and would not have hesitated to murder
him as a simpler way of disposing of the difficulty,
was named by Cinq-Mars as a proper person to deal
with the Spaniards. He set out for Madrid, and
soon succeeded in negotiating a secret treaty, in
the name of the Duke of Orleans, by whose terms
Spain was to furnish the conspirators with twelve
thousand foot, five thousand horse, and the necessary
funds for the enterprise. The town of Sedan,
and the names of Cinq-Mars and Bouillon, were not
mentioned in this treaty, but were given in a
separate document.</p>

<p>While this dangerous work was going on the cardinal
was dangerously ill, a prey to violent fever,
and with an abscess on his arm which prevented
him from writing. The king was with the army,
which was besieging Perpignan. With him was
Cinq-Mars, who was doing his best to insinuate
suspicions of the minister into the mind of the
king. All seemed promising for the conspirators,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the illness of the cardinal, in their opinion, being
likely to carry him off in no long period, and meanwhile
preventing him from discovering the plot
and setting himself right with the king.</p>

<p>Evidently these hopeful people did not know the
resources of Cardinal Richelieu. In all his severe
illness his eyes had not been blind, his intellect not
at rest. Keen as they thought themselves, they had
a man with double their resources to deal with.
Though Richelieu was by no means surrounded by
the intricate web of spies and intrigues with which
fiction and the drama have credited him, he was
not without his secret agents, and his means of
tracing the most hidden movements of his enemies.
Cinq-Mars lacked the caution necessary for a conspirator.
His purposes became evident to the king,
who had no thought of exchanging his great minister
for a frivolous boy who was only fitted to amuse
his hours of relaxation. The outcome of the affair
appears in a piece of news published in the <i>Gazette
de France</i> on June 21, 1642.</p>

<p>"The cardinal-duke," it said, "after remaining
two days at Arles, embarked on the 11th of this
month for Tarascon, his health becoming better and
better. The king has ordered under arrest Marquis
de Cinq-Mars, grand equerry of France."</p>

Had a thunderbolt fallen in their midst, the enemies
of Richelieu could not have been in greater
consternation than at this simple item of news.
<p>How came it about? The fox was not asleep. Nor
had his illness robbed his hand and his brain of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
their cunning. The king, overladen with affairs
of state from which his minister when well had
usually relieved him, sent a message of confidence
to Richelieu, indicating that his enemies would
seek in vain to separate them. In reply the cardinal
sent the king a document which filled the
monarch with an astonishment that was only
equalled by his wrath. It was a copy of the secret
treaty of Orleans with Spain!</p>

<p>The king could hardly believe his eyes. So this
was what lay behind the insinuations of Cinq-Mars?
An insurrection was projected against the state!
The cardinal, mayhap the king himself, was to be
overthrown by force of arms! Only the sleepless
vigilance of Richelieu could have discovered and
exposed this perilous plot. It remained for the king
to second the work of his minister by decisive action.
An order was at once issued for the arrest of Cinq-Mars
and his intimate friend, M. de Thou; while a
messenger was sent off in all haste to the army of
Italy, bearing orders for the arrest of the Duke of
Bouillon at the head of his troops.</p>

<p>Fontrailles, just arrived from his mission to
Spain, returned to that kingdom with all haste,
having first said to Cinq-Mars, "Sir, you are a
fine figure; if you were shorter by the whole head
you would not cease to be very tall. As for me, who
am already very short, nothing could be taken off
me without inconveniencing me and making me
cut the poorest figure in the world. You will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
good enough, if you please, to let me get out of the
way of edge tools."</p>

<p>The minor parties to the conspiracy, with the
exception of the prudent Fontrailles, were in custody.
The most guilty of all, the king's brother,
was at large. What part was he to play in the
drama of retribution? Flight, or treachery to his
accomplices, alone remained to him. He chose the
latter, sending an agent to the king, who had just
joined the cardinal at Tarascon, with directions
to confess everything and implore for him the
pardon of his royal brother. The cardinal questioned
this agent, the Abb&eacute; de la Rivi&egrave;re, with unrelenting
severity, made him write and sign everything,
and was inclined to make the prince-duke
appear as a witness at the trial, and yield up his
accomplices in the face of the world. This final
disgrace, however, was omitted at the wish of Louis,
and an order of exile was sent from the king to his
brother, which bore this note in the cardinal's
hand,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur will have in his place of exile twelve
thousand crowns a month, the same sum that the
king of Spain had promised to give him."</p>

<p>The dying cardinal had triumphed over all his
foes. He had, from his bed at Tarascon, dictated
to the king the course to be pursued, entailing dishonor
to the Duke of Orleans and death to the
grand equerry of France. The king then took his
way back to Fontainebleau in the litter of the cardinal,
which the latter had lent him. Richelieu
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
did not remain long behind him. He was conveyed
to his house in Lyons in a litter shaped like a square
chamber, covered with red damask, and borne on
the shoulders of eighteen guards. Within, beside
his couch, was a table covered with papers, at
which he worked with his ordinary diligence, chatting
pleasantly at intervals with such of his servants
as accompanied him. In the same equipage
he left Lyons for the Loire, on his return to Paris.
On the way it was necessary to pull down walls and
bridge ditches that this great litter, in which the
greatest man in France lay in mortal illness, might
pass.</p>

<p>What followed needs few words. The Duke of
Bouillon confessed everything, and was pardoned
on condition of his delivering up Sedan to the king.
He was kept in prison, however, till after the death
of his accomplices, Cinq-Mars and De Thou, who
were tried and sentenced to execution.</p>

<p>Bouillon had not long to wait. The execution
took place on the very day on which sentence had
been pronounced. The two culprits met death
firmly. Cinq-Mars was but twenty-two years of
age. He had rapidly run his course. "Now that
I make not a single step which does not lead me
to death, I am more capable than anybody else of
estimating the value of the things of the world,"
he wrote. "Enough of this world; away to Paradise!"
said De Thou, as he walked to the scaffold.</p>

<p>There were no more conspiracies against Richelieu.
There was no time for them, for in less than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
three months afterwards he was dead. The greatest,
or at least the most dramatic, minister known
to the pages of history had departed from this
world. His royal master did not long survive him.
In five months afterwards, Louis XIII. had followed
his minister to the grave.

<a name="h2-21" id="h2-21"></a><h2><i>THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS.</i></h2>


<p>In the streets of Paris all was tumult and fiery
indignation. Never had there been a more sudden
or violent outbreak. The whole city seemed to have
turned into the streets. Not until the era of the
Revolution, a century and a half later, was the
capital of France again to see such an uprising
of the people against the court. Broussel had been
arrested, Councillor Broussel, a favorite of the populace,
who sustained him in his opposition to the
court party, and at once the city was ablaze; for
the first time in the history of France had the
people risen in support of their representatives.</p>

<p>It was by no means the first time that royalty
had ended its disputes with the Parliament in this
summary manner. Four years previously, Anne of
Austria, the queen-regent, had done the same thing,
and scarce a voice had been raised in protest. But
in the ensuing four years public opinion had
changed. The king, Louis XIV., was but ten years
old; his mother, aided by her favorite minister,
Cardinal Mazarin, ruled the kingdom,&mdash;misruled
it, as the people thought; the country was crushed
under its weight of taxes; the finances were in
utter disorder; France was successful abroad, but
her successes had been dearly bought, and the people
groaned under the burden of their victories. Parliament
made itself the mouth-piece of the public
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>discontent. It no longer felt upon it the iron hand
of Richelieu. Mazarin was able, but he was not a
master, and the Parliament began once more to
claim that authority in affairs of state from which
it had been deposed by the great cardinal. A conflict
arose between the members and the court which
soon led to acts of open hostility.</p>

<p>An edict laying a tax upon all provisions which
entered Paris irritated the citizens, and the Parliament
refused to register it. Other steps towards
independence were taken by the members. Gradually
they resumed their old rights, and the court
party was forced to yield. But courage returned to
the queen-regent with the news that the army of
France had gained a great victory. No sooner had
the tidings reached Paris than the city was electrified
by hearing that President Brancmesnil and
Councillor Broussel had been arrested.</p>

<p>It was the arrest of Broussel that stirred the
popular heart. Mazarin and the queen had made
the dangerous mistake of not taking into account
the state of the public mind. "There was a blaze
at once, a sensation, a rush, an outcry, and a shutting
up of shops." The excitement of the people
was intense. Moment by moment the tumult grew
greater. "Broussel! Broussel!" they shouted.
That perilous populace had arisen which was afterwards
to show what frightful deeds it could do
under the impulse of oppression and misgovernment.</p>

<p>Paul de Gondi, afterwards known as Cardinal De
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Retz, then coadjutor of the Archbishop of Paris,
and the leading spirit with the populace, hurried
to the palace, accompanied by Marshal de la
Meilleraie.</p>

<p>"The city is in a frightful state," they told the
queen. "The people are furious and may soon
grow unmanageable. The air is full of revolt."</p>

<p>Anne of Austria listened to them with set lips
and angry eyes.</p>

<p>"There is revolt in imagining there can be revolt,"
she sternly replied. "These are the ridiculous
stories of those who favor trouble; the king's
authority will soon restore order."</p>

<p>M. de Guitant, an old courtier, who entered as
she was speaking, declared that the coadjutor had
barely represented the facts, and said that he did
not see how anybody could sleep with things in such
a state.</p>

<p>"Well, M. de Guitant, and what is your advice?"
asked De Retz.</p>

<p>"My advice is to give up that old rascal of a
Broussel, dead or alive."</p>

<p>"To give him up dead," said the coadjutor,
"would not accord with either the piety or the
prudence of the queen; to yield him alive might
quiet the people."</p>

<p>The queen turned to him a face hot with anger,
and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I understand you, Mr. Coadjutor; you would
have me set Broussel at liberty. I would strangle
him with these hands first!" As she finished these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
words she put her hands close to the coadjutor's
face, and added, in a threatening tone, "And those
who&mdash;" Her voice ceased; he was left to infer
the rest.</p>

<p>Yet, despite this infatuation of the queen, it was
evident that something must be done, if Paris was
to be saved. The people grew more tumultuous.
Fresh tidings continued to come in, each more
threatening than the last. The queen at length
yielded so far as to promise that Broussel should
be set free if the people would first disperse and
cease their tumultuous behavior.</p>

<p>The coadjutor was bidden to proclaim this in the
streets. He asked for an order to sustain him, but
the queen refused to give it, and withdrew "to her
little gray room," angry at herself for yielding so
far as she had.</p>

<p>De Retz did not find the situation a very pleasant
one for himself. Mazarin pushed him gently
towards the door, saying, "Restore the peace of
the realm." Marshal Meilleraie drew him onward.
He went into the street, wearing his robe of office,
and bestowing benedictions right and left, though
while doing so his mind was busy in considering
how he was going to get out of the difficulty which
lay before him.</p>

<p>It grew worse instead of better. Marshal Meilleraie,
losing his head through excitement, advanced
waving his sword in the air, and shouting at the
top of his voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the king! Liberation for Broussel!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>This did very well for those within hearing; but
his sword provoked far more than his voice quieted;
those at a distance looked on his action as a menace,
and their fury was augmented. On all sides there
was a rush for arms. Stones were flung by the
rioters, one of which struck De Retz and felled him
to the earth. As he picked himself up an excited
youth rushed at him and put a musket to his head.
Only the wit and readiness of the coadjutor saved
him from imminent peril.</p>

<p>"Though I did not know him a bit," says De
Retz, in his "Memoirs," "I thought it would not be
well to let him suppose so at such a moment; on
the contrary, I said to him, 'Ah, wretch, if thy
father saw thee!' He thought I was the best friend
of his father, on whom, however, I had never set
eyes."</p>

<p>The fellow withdrew, ashamed of his violence,
and before any further attack could be made upon
De Retz he was recognized by the people and
dragged to the market-place, constantly crying out
as he went, "The queen has promised to restore
Broussel."</p>

<p>The good news by this time had spread through
the multitude, whose cries of anger were giving
place to shouts of joy. Their arms were hastily
disposed of, and a great throng, thirty or forty
thousand in number, followed the coadjutor to the
Palais-Royal. When he entered, Marshal Meilleraie
turned to the queen and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madame,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
here is he to whom I owe my life,
and your Majesty the safety of the Palais-Royal."</p>

<p>The queen's answer was an incredulous smile.
On seeing it, the hasty temper of the marshal broke
out in an oath.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, hotly, "no proper man can
venture to flatter you in the state in which things
are; and if you do not this very day set Broussel at
liberty, to-morrow there will not be left one stone
upon another in Paris."</p>

<p>Anne of Austria, carried away by her pride and
superciliousness, could not be brought to believe
that the populace would dare attempt an actual
revolt against the king. De Retz would have
spoken in support of the marshal's words, but she
cut him short, saying in a tone of mockery,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go and rest yourself, sir; you have worked
very hard."</p>

<p>He left the palace in a rage. It was increased
when word was brought to him that he had been
ridiculed at the supper-table of the queen. She had
gone so far as to blame him for increasing the
tumult, and threatened to make an example of him
and to interdict the Parliament. In short, the
exercise of power had made the woman mad. De
Retz reflected. If the queen designed to punish
him, she should have something to punish him for.
He was not the man to be made a cat's-paw of.</p>

<p>"We are not in such bad case as you suppose,
gentlemen," he said to his friends. "There is an
intention of crushing the public; it is for me to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
defend it from oppression; to-morrow before mid-day
I shall be master of Paris."</p>

<p>Anne of Austria had made an enemy of one who
had been her strong friend, a bold and restless man,
capable of great deeds. He had long taken pains to
make himself popular in Paris. During that night
he and his emissaries worked in secret upon the
people. Early the next day the mob was out again,
arms in hand, and ripe for mischief. The chancellor,
on his way to the Palace of Justice, suddenly
found his carriage surrounded by these rioters.
He hastily sought refuge in the H&ocirc;tel de Luynes.
The mob followed him, pillaging as they went,
destroying the furniture, seeking the fugitive. He
had taken refuge in a small chamber, where, thinking
that his last hour had come, he knelt in confession
before his brother, the Bishop of Meaux. Fortunately
for him the rioters failed to discover him,
and were led away by another fancy.</p>

<p>"It was like a sudden and violent conflagration
lighted up from the Pont Neuf over the whole city,"
says De Retz. "Everybody without exception took
up arms. Children of five and six years of age
were seen dagger in hand, and the mothers themselves
carried them. In less than two hours there
were in Paris more than two hundred barricades,
bordered with flags and all the arms that the League
had left entire. Everybody cried 'Hurrah, for
the king!' but echo answered, 'None of your
Mazarin!'"</p>

<p>It was an incipient revolution, but it was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
minister and the regent, not the king, against whom
the people had risen, its object being the support
of the Parliament of Paris, not the States General
of the kingdom. France was not yet ready for the
radical work reserved for a later day. The turbulent
Parisians were in the street, arms in hand,
but they had not yet lost the sentiment of loyalty
to the king. A century and a half more of misrule
were needed to complete this transformation in the
national idea.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, the coadjutor, the
soul of the outbreak, kept at home, vowing that he
was powerless to control the people. At an early
hour the Parliament assembled at the Palace of
Justice, but its deliberations were interrupted by
shouts of "Broussel! Broussel!" from the immense
multitude which filled every adjoining
avenue. Only the release of the arrested members
could appease the mob. The Parliament determined
to go in a body and demand this of the queen.</p>

<p>Their journey was an eventful one. Paris was in
insurrection. Everywhere they found the people in
arms, while barricades were thrown up at every
hundred paces. Through the shouting and howling
mob they made their way to the queen's palace, the
ushers in front, with their square caps, the members
following in their robes, at their head M. Mol&eacute;,
their premier president.</p>

<p>The conference with the queen was a passionate
one. M. Mol&eacute; spoke for the Parliament, representing
to the queen the extreme danger Paris was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
in, the peril to all France, unless the prisoners
were released and the sedition allayed. He spoke
to a woman "who feared nothing because she knew
but little," and who was just then controlled by
pride and passion instead of reason.</p>

<p>"I am quite aware that there is a disturbance in
the city," she answered, furiously; "but you shall
answer to me for it, gentlemen of the Parliament,
you, your wives, and your children."</p>

<p>With further threats that the king would remember
the cause of these evils, when he reached his
majority, the incensed woman flouted from the
chamber of audience, slamming the door violently
behind her. To deal with her, in her present mood,
was evidently impracticable. The members left the
palace to return. They quickly found themselves
surrounded by an angry mob, furious at their non-success,
disposed to hold them responsible for the
failure. On their arrival at the Rue St. Honor&eacute;,
just as they were about to turn on to the Pont
Neuf, a band of about two hundred men advanced
threateningly upon them, headed by a cook-shop
lad, armed with a halberd, which he thrust against
M. Mol&eacute;'s body, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Turn, traitor, and if thou wouldst not thyself
be slain, give up to us Broussel, or Mazarin and the
chancellor as hostages."</p>

<p>Mol&eacute; quietly put the weapon aside.</p>

<p>"You forget yourself," he said, with calm dignity,
"and are oblivious of the respect you owe to
my office."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>The mob, however, was past the point of paying
respect to dignitaries. They hustled the members,
threatened the president with swords and pistols,
and several times tried to drag him into a private
house. But he resisted, and was aided by members
and friends who surrounded him. Slowly the parliamentary
body made its way back to the Palais-Royal,
whither they had resolved to return, M. Mol&eacute;
preserving his dignity of mien and movement,
despite the "running fire of insults, threats, execrations,
and blasphemies," that arose from every
side. They reached the palace, at length, in diminished
numbers, many of the members having
dropped out of the procession.</p>

<p>The whole court was assembled in the gallery.
Mol&eacute; spoke first. He was a man of great natural
eloquence, who was at his best as an orator when
surrounded by peril, and he depicted the situation
so graphically that all present, except the queen,
were in terror. "Monsieur made as if he would
throw himself upon his knees before the queen,
who remained inflexible," says De Retz; "four or
five princesses, who were trembling with fear, did
throw themselves at her feet; the queen of England,
who had come that day from St. Germain, represented
that the troubles had never been so serious
at their commencement in England, nor the feelings
so heated or united."</p>

<p>Paris, in short, was on the eve of a revolution,
and the queen could not be made to see it. Cardinal
Mazarin, who was present, and who had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
severely dealt with in the speeches, some of the
orators telling him, in mockery, that if he would
only go as far as the Pont Neuf he would learn for
himself how things were, now joined the others in
entreating Anne of Austria to give way. She did
so at length, consenting to the release of Broussel,
though "not without a deep sigh, which showed
what violence she did her feelings in the struggle."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p242" id="p242"></a>
<img src="images/p242.jpg" alt="CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME. PARIS." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME. PARIS.</span></div>

<p>It is an interesting spectacle to see this woman,
moved by sheer pride and obstinacy, conjoined with
ignorance of the actual situation, seeking to set
her single will against that of a city in revolt, and
endangering the very existence of the monarchy
by her sheer lack of reason. Her consent, for the
time being, settled the difficulty, though the passions
which had been aroused were not easily to be set at
rest. Broussel was released and took his seat again
in the Parliament, and the people returned to their
homes, satisfied, for the time, with their victory
over the queen and the cardinal.</p>

<p>In truth, a contest had arisen which was yet
to yield important consequences. The Prince of
Cond&eacute; had arrived in Paris during these events.
He had the prestige of a successful general; he
did not like the cardinal, and he looked on the Parliament
as imprudent and insolent.</p>

<p>"If I should join hands with them," he said to
De Retz, "it might be best for my interests, but my
name is Louis de Bourbon, and I do not wish to
shake the throne. These devils of square-caps, are
they mad about bringing me either to commence a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
civil war, or to put a rope round their own necks?
I will let them see that they are not the potentates
they think themselves, and that they may easily be
brought to reason."</p>

<p>"The cardinal may possibly be mistaken in his
measures," answered De Retz. "He will find Paris
a hard nut to crack."</p>

<p>"It will not be taken, like Dunkerque, by mining
and assaults," retorted the prince, angrily; "but
if the bread of Gonesse were to fail them for a
week&mdash;" He left the coadjutor to imagine the
consequences.</p>

<p>The contest continued. In January, 1649, the
queen, the boy king, and the whole court set out by
night for the castle of St. Germain. It was unfurnished,
with scarcely a bundle of straw to lie
upon, but the queen could not have been more gay
"had she won a battle, taken Paris, and had all who
had displeased her hanged, and nevertheless she
was very far from all that."</p>

<p>Far enough, indeed. Paris was in the hands of
her enemies, who were as gay as the queen. On the
8th of January the Parliament of Paris decreed
Cardinal Mazarin an enemy to the king and the
state, and bade all subjects of the king to hunt him
down. War was declared against the queen regent
and her favorite, the cardinal. Had it been the
States-General in place of the Parliament, the
French Revolution might have then and there
begun.</p>

<p>Many of the greatest lords joined the side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
people. Troops were levied in the city, their command
being offered to the Prince of Conti. The
Parliaments of Aix and Rouen voted to support
that of Paris. It was decreed that all the royal
funds, in the exchequers of the kingdom, should be
seized and used for the defence of the people. All
was festivity in the city. The versatile people
seemed to imagine that to declare war was to decree
victory. There was dancing everywhere within the
walls. There was the rumble of war without. The
Prince of Cond&eacute;, at the head of the king's troops,
had taken the post of Charentin from the Frondeurs,
as the malcontents called themselves, and had
carried out his threat of checking the flow of bread
to the city. The gay Parisians were beginning to
feel the inconvenience of hunger.</p>

<p>What followed is too long a story to be told here,
except in bare epitome. A truce was patched up
between the contending parties. Bread flowed
again into Paris. The seared and hungry people
grew courageous and violent again when their appetites
were satisfied. When M. Mol&eacute; and his fellows
returned to Paris with a treaty of peace which they
had signed, the populace gathered round them in
fury.</p>

<p>"None of your peace! None of your Mazarin!"
they angrily shouted. "We must go to St. Germain
to seek our good king! We must fling into
the river all the Mazarins."</p>

<p>One of them laid his hand threateningly on
President Mol&eacute;'s arm. The latter looked him in
the face calmly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you have killed me," he said, quietly, "I
shall only need six feet of earth."</p>

<p>"You can get back to your house secretly by
way of the record offices," whispered one of his
companions.</p>

<p>"The court never hides itself," he composedly
replied. "If I were certain to perish, I would not
commit this poltroonery, which, moreover, would
but give courage to the rioters. They would seek
me in my house if they thought I shrank from them
here."</p>

<p>M. Mol&eacute; was a man of courage. To face a mob is
at times more dangerous than to face an army.</p>

<p>Paris was in disorder. The agitation was spreading
all over France. But the army was faithful to
the king, and without it the Fronde was powerless.
The outbreak had ended in a treaty of peace and
amnesty in which the Parliament had in a measure
won, as it had preserved all its rights and privileges.</p>

<p>It was to be a short peace. Cond&eacute;, elated by
having beaten the Fronde, claimed a lion's share in
the government. His brother, the Prince of Conti,
and his sister, the Duchess of Longueville, joined
him in these pretensions. The affair ended in a
bold step on the part of Mazarin and the queen.
The two princes and M. de Longueville were
arrested and conveyed to the castle of Vincennes,
while the princesses were ordered to retire to their
estates, and the Duchess of Longueville, fearing
arrest, fled in haste to Normandy.</p>

<p>For the present the star of the cardinal was in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the ascendant. But his master-stroke set war on
foot again. The Parliament of Paris supported
the princes. Their partisans rallied. Bordeaux
broke into insurrection. Elsewhere hot blood declared
itself. The Duke of Orleans joined the party
of the prisoners. The Parliament enjoined all the
officers of the crown to obey none but the duke,
the lieutenant-general of the kingdom. On the
night of February 6, 1651, Mazarin set out again
for St. Germain. Paris had become far too hot
to hold him.</p>

<p>The tidings of his flight brought the people into
the streets again. The Duke of Orleans informed
Cardinal de Retz that the queen proposed to follow
her flying minister, with the boy king.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" he asked, somewhat
helplessly. "It is a bad business; but how are we
to stop it?"</p>

<p>"How?" cried the more practical De Retz;
"why, by shutting the gates of Paris, to begin
with. The king must not go."</p>

<p>Within an hour the emissaries of the ready coadjutor
were rousing up the people right and left with
the tidings of the projected flight of the queen with
her son. Soon the city swarmed again with armed
and angry men, the gates were seized, mounted
guards patrolled the streets, the crowd surged
towards the Palais-Royal.</p>

<p>Within the palace all was alarm and confusion.
Anne of Austria had indeed been on the point of
flight. Her son was in his travelling-dress. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the people were at the door, clamoring to see the
king, threatening dire consequences if the doors
were not opened to them. They could not long be
kept out; some immediate action must be taken.
The boy's travelling-attire was quickly replaced by
his night dress, and he was laid in bed, his mother
cautioning him to lie quiet and feign sleep.</p>

<p>"The king! we must see the king!" came the
vociferous cry from the street. "Open! the people
demand to see their king."</p>

<p>The doors were forced; the mob was in the
palace; clamor and tumult reigned below the royal
chambers. The queen sent word to the people that
the king was asleep in his bed. They might enter
and see him if they would promise to tread softly
and keep strict silence. This message at once
stopped the tumult; the noise subsided; the people
began to file into the room, stepping as noiselessly
as though shod with down, gazing with awed eyes
on the seemingly sleeping face of the boy king.</p>

<p>The queen stood at the pillow of her son, a graceful
and beautiful woman, her outstretched arm
holding back the heavy folds of the drapery, her
face schooled to quiet repose. Louis lay with closed
eyes and regular breathing, playing his part well.
For hours a stream of the men and women of Paris
flowed through the chamber, moving in reverential
silence, gazing on the boy's face as on a sacred
treasure of their own. Till three o'clock in the
morning the movement continued, the queen standing
all this time like a beautiful statue, her son
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
still feigning slumber. It was a scene of remarkable
and picturesque character.</p>

<p>That night of strain and excitement passed. The
king was with them still, of that the people were
assured; he must remain with them, there must be
an end of midnight flights. The patrol was kept
up, the gates watched, the king was a prisoner in
the hands of the Parisians.</p>

<p>"The king, our master, is a captive," said M.
Mol&eacute;, voicing to the Parliament the queen's complaint.</p>

<p>"He <i>was</i> a captive, in the hands of Mazarin,"
replied the Duke of Orleans; "but, thank God, he
is so no longer."</p>

<p>The people had won. Mazarin was beaten. He
hastened to La Havre, where the princes were then
confined, and set them at liberty himself. His
power in France, for the time, was at an end. He
made his way to the frontier, which he crossed on
the 12th of March. He was just in time: the
Parliament of Paris had issued orders for his arrest,
wherever found in France.</p>

<p>We must end here, with this closing of the contest
between Mazarin and the Fronde. History goes
on to tell that the contest was reopened, Mazarin
returned, there was battle in Paris, the Fronde
failed, and Mazarin died in office.</p>

<p>The popular outbreak here briefly chronicled is of
interest from the fact that it immediately followed
the success of the insurrection in England and the
execution of Charles I. The provocation was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
same in the two nations; the result highly different.
In both cases it was a revolt against the tyranny of
the court and the attempt to establish absolutism.
But the difference in results lay in the fact that
England had a single parliament, composed of politicians,
while France had ten parliaments, composed
of magistrates, and unaccustomed to handle great
questions of public policy. Richelieu had taken
from the civic parliaments of France what little
power they possessed, and they were but shadowy
prototypes of the English representative assembly.
"Without any unity of action or aim, and by turns
excited and dismayed by the examples that came to
them from England, the Frondeurs had to guide
them no Hampden or Cromwell; they had at their
backs neither people nor army; the English had
been able to accomplish a revolution; the Fronde
failed before the dexterous prudence of Mazarin
and the queen's fidelity to her minister."</p>

<p>There lay before France a century and a half of
autocratic rule and popular suffering; then was to
come the convening of the States-General, the rise
of the people, and the final downfall of absolute
royalty and feudal privileges in the red tide of the
Revolution.

<a name="h2-22" id="h2-22"></a><h2><i>A MARTYR
TO HIS PROFESSION.</i></h2>

<p>The grounds of the Ch&acirc;teau de Chantilly, that
charming retreat of the Prince de Cond&eacute;, shone
with all the splendor which artistic adornments,
gleaming lanterns of varied form and color, splendidly-costumed
dames and richly-attired cavaliers
could give them, the whole scene having a fairy-like
beauty and richness wonderfully pleasing to the eye.
For more than a mile from the entrance to the
grounds men holding lighted torches bordered the
road, while in all the villages leading thither the
peasants were out in their gala attire, and triumphal
arches of verdure were erected in honor of the king,
Louis XIV., who was on his way thither to visit
Monsieur le Prince.</p>

<p>He was coming, the great Louis, the Grand
Monarque of France, and noble and peasant alike
were out to bid him welcome, while the artistic skill
of the day had exhausted itself in efforts to provide
him a splendid reception. And now there could be
heard on the road the trampling of horses, the
clanking of swords, the voices of approaching men,
and a gallant cavalcade wheeled at length into the
grounds, announcing that the king was close at
hand. A few minutes of anxious expectation
passed, and then the king, attended by a large group
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of courtiers, came sweeping grandly forward, while
at the same moment a gleaming display of fireworks,
at the end of the avenue, blazed off in fiery
greeting. As the coruscating lights faded out
Cond&eacute; met the king in his coach, which he invited
him to enter, and off they drove to the ch&acirc;teau,
followed by a shining swarm of grand dames and
great lords who had gathered to this f&ecirc;te from all
parts of France.</p>

<p>Within the ch&acirc;teau as much had been done as
without to render honor to the occasion. Hundreds
of retainers lined chamber and hall in splendid
attire, their only duty being to add life and
richness to the scene. The rooms were luxuriously
furnished, the banqueting hall was a scene for a
painter, and the banquet a triumph of the art of
the cuisine, for was it not prepared by the genius
of Vatel, the great Vatel, the most famous of cooks
ministering to the most showy of monarchs!</p>

<p>All went well; the king feasted on delicacies
which were a triumph of art; Louis was satisfied;
Vatel triumphed; so far the f&ecirc;te was a success. In
the evening the king played at piquet, the cavaliers
and ladies promenaded through the splendidly-furnished
and richly-lighted saloons, some cracked
jokes on sofas, some made love in alcoves, still all
went well.</p>

<p>For the next day the programme included a
grand promenade <i>&agrave; la mode de Versailles</i>, a collation
in the park, under great trees laden with the
freshest verdure of spring, a stag-hunt by moonlight,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
a brilliant display of fireworks, then a supper
in the banqueting hall of the ch&acirc;teau. And still
all went well. At least all thought so but Vatel;
but as for that prince of cooks, he was in despair.
A frightful disaster had occurred. After the days
and nights of anxiety and care in preparing for this
grand occasion, for a failure now to take place,
it was to him unpardonable, unsupportable.</p>

<p>Tidings of his distress were brought to Cond&eacute;.
The generous prince sought his room to console
him.</p>

<p>"Vatel," said he, "what is this I hear? The
king's supper was superb."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," said Vatel, tears in his eyes.
"The <i>r&ocirc;ti</i> was wanting at two tables."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the prince. "You surpassed
yourself; nothing could have been better;
everything was perfect."</p>

<p>Vatel, somewhat relieved by this praise, sought
his couch, and a morsel of sleep visited his eyelids.
But the shadow of doom still hung over his career.
By break of day he was up again. Others might lie
late abed, but there could be no such indulgence for
him; for was not he the power behind the throne?
What would this grand f&ecirc;te be should his genius
fail, his powers prove unequal to the strain? King
and prince, lord and lady might slumber, but Vatel
must be up and alert.</p>

<p>Fresh fish formed an essential part of the menu
which he had laid out for the dining-tables of the
third day. He had ordered them from every part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
of the coast. Would they come? Could the fates
fail him now, at this critical moment of his life?
The anxious chief went abroad to view the situation.
His eyes lighted. A fisher-boy had just arrived
with two loads of fish, fresh brought from the coast.
Vatel looked at them, and then gazed around with
newly disturbed eyes.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he asked, his voice faltering.</p>

<p>"That is all, sir," answered the boy, who knew
nothing about the numerous orders.</p>

<p>Vatel turned pale. All? These few fish all he
had to offer his multitude of guests? Only a
miracle could divide these so as to give a portion
to each. He waited, despair slowly descending
upon his heart. In vain his anxious wait; no more
fish appeared. Vatel's anxiety was fast becoming
despair. The disaster of the night before, to be
followed by this terrible stroke&mdash;it was more than
his artistic soul could bear; disgrace had come
upon him in its direst form; his reputation was at
stake.</p>

<p>He met Gourville, a wit and factotum of the
court, and told him of his misfortune.</p>

<p>"It is disgrace, ruin," he cried; "I cannot survive
it."</p>

<p>Gourville heard him with merry laughter. To
his light mind the affair seemed only a good joke.
It was not so to Vatel. He sought his room and
locked himself in.</p>

<p>He was too soon, alas, too soon; for now fish are
coming; here, there, everywhere; the orders have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
been strictly obeyed, there is abundance for all purposes.
The cooks receive them, and look for Vatel
to give orders for their disposal. He is not to be
seen. "He went to his room," says Gourville.
They repair thither, knock persistently, but in vain,
and finding that no answer can be obtained, they
break open the door and enter.</p>

<p>A frightful spectacle meets their eyes. On the
floor before them lies poor Vatel, in a pool of his
own blood, pierced through the heart. In his
ecstasy of despair at the non-arrival of the fish, he
had fastened his sword in the door, and thrown
himself upon its deadly point. Thrice he had done
so, twice wounding himself slightly, the third time
piercing himself through the heart. Poor fellow!
he was dead, and the fish had arrived. It was a
useless sacrifice of his life to his art.</p>

<p>The tidings of the tragedy filled the ch&acirc;teau with
alarm and dismay. The prince was in despair, the
more so as the king blamed him for the fatal occurrence.
He had long avoided Chantilly, he said,
knowing that his coming would occasion inconvenience,
since his host would insist on providing
for the whole of his suite. There should have been
but two tables, and there were more than twenty-five;
the strain on poor Vatel was the cause of his
death and the loss of one of the ornaments of the
reign. He would never allow such extravagance
again. Men like Vatel were not to be so lightly
sacrificed.</p>

<p>While the king thus petulantly scolded his great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
subject in the time-honored "I told you so" fashion,
the whole ch&acirc;teau buzzed with opinions about
the tragic event. "Vatel has played the hero,"
said some; "He has played the idiot," said others.
Some praised his courage and devotion to his art;
others blamed his haste and folly. But praise prevailed
over blame, for, as all conceded, "he had died
for the honor of his profession," and no soldier
or martyr could do more.</p>

<p>But Vatel was gone, and dinner was not served.
The dead was dead, but appetite remained. What
was to be done? Gourville sprang into the breach
and undertook to replace Vatel. The fish were
cooked, the company dined, then they promenaded,
then they played piquet, losing and winning largely,
then they supped, then they enjoyed a moonlight
chase of the deer in the park of Chantilly. Mirth
and gayety prevailed, and before bedtime came poor
Vatel was forgotten. The cook who had died for
his art was as far from their thoughts as the
martyrs of centuries before.</p>

<p>Early the next day the king and his train departed,
leaving Cond&eacute; to count the cost of the entertainment,
which had been so great as to make him
agree with Louis, that hereafter two tables would be
better than twenty-five. Doubtless among his chief
losses he counted Vatel. Money could be found
again, waste repaired, but a genius of the kitchen
the equal of Vatel was not to be had to order. Men
like him are the growth of centuries. He died that
his name might live.

<a name="h2-23" id="h2-23"></a><h2><i>THE MAN WITH THE
IRON MASK.</i></h2>

<p>In the year 1662, the first year of the absolute
reign of Louis XIV., there occurred an event without
parallel in history, and which still remains
shrouded in the mystery in which it was from the
first involved. There was sent with the utmost
secrecy to the Ch&acirc;teau of Pignerol an unknown prisoner,
whose identity was kept secret with the most
extreme care. All that can be said of him is that he
was young, well-formed and attractive in appearance,
and above the usual stature. As for his face,
whether it were handsome or ill-favored, noble or
base, no man could say, for it was concealed by an
impenetrable mask, the lower portion of which was
made movable by steel springs, so that he could eat
with it on, while the upper portion was immovably
fixed.</p>

<p>This mysterious state prisoner remained for a
number of years at Pignerol, under charge of its
governor, M. de Saint Mars, an officer of the greatest
discretion and trustworthiness. He was afterwards
removed to the castle of the Isle of Sainte
Marguerite, on the coast of Provence, where he
remained for years in the same mysterious seclusion,
an object of the greatest curiosity on the part of
all the people of the prison, and of no less interest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
to the people of the kingdom, to whose love of the
marvellous the secrecy surrounding him appealed.
The mask was never removed, day or night, so far
as any one could learn, while conjecture sought in
vain to discover who this mysterious personage
could be.</p>

<p>This much was certain, no person of leading importance
had disappeared from Europe in the year
1662. On the other hand, the masked prisoner was
treated with a consideration which could be looked
for only by persons of the highest birth. The Marquis
of Louvois, minister of war under the "Grand
Monarque," was said to have visited him at Sainte
Marguerite, and to have treated him with the
respect due to one of royal birth. He spoke to him
standing, as to one far his superior in station, and
showed him throughout the interview the greatest
deference.</p>

<p>In 1698, M. de Saint Mars was made governor of
the Bastille. He brought with him this mysterious
masked prisoner, whose secret it was apparently not
deemed advisable to intrust to a new governor of
Sainte Marguerite. As to what took place on the
journey, we have some interesting details in a letter
from M. de Formanoir, grand nephew of Saint
Mars.</p>

<p>"In 1698, M. de Saint Mars exchanged the governorship
of the islands [Sainte Marguerite and
Sainte Honnat] for that of the Bastille. When he
set out to enter on his new office he stayed with his
prisoner for a short time at Palteau, his estate.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
The mask arrived in a litter which preceded that of
M. de Saint Mars; they were accompanied by several
men on horseback. The peasants went out to
meet their seigneur. M. de Saint Mars took his
meals with his prisoner, who sat with his back
towards the windows of the room, which looked into
the court-yard. The peasants of whom I made inquiry
could not see if he had his mask on when
eating; but they observed that M. de Saint Mars,
who sat opposite to him at table, had a pair of pistols
beside his plate. They were attended by a
single valet only, Antoine Ru, who took away the
dishes set down to him in an antechamber, having
first carefully shut the door of the dining-room.
When the prisoner crossed the court-yard a black
mask was always on his face."</p>

<p>The extreme caution here indicated was continued
until the prisoner reached the Bastille. With regard
to his life in this fortress we are better
informed, since it must be acknowledged that the
record of his previous prison life is somewhat
obscure. All that seems well established is that he
was one of the "two prisoners of the Lower Tower"
at Pignerol, in 1681; that he was spoken of to
Saint Mars as "your ancient prisoner," and "your
prisoner of twenty years' standing;" that in 1687
he was removed from Exiles to Sainte Marguerite
with the same care and secrecy observed in the
journey to the Bastille, his jailer accompanying
him to the new prison, and that throughout he was
under the care of the relentless Saint Mars.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the life of this remarkable state prisoner in
the Bastille we have more detailed accounts. Dujunca,
the chief turnkey of that prison, has left a
journal, which contains the following entry: "On
Thursday, the 18th September, 1698, at three
o'clock in the afternoon, M. de Saint Mars, the
governor, arrived at the Bastille for the first time
from the islands of Sainte Marguerite and Sainte
Honnat. He brought with him in his own litter an
ancient prisoner formerly under his care at Pignerol,
and whose name remains untold. This prisoner
was always kept masked, and was at first lodged
in the Basini&egrave;re tower.... I conducted him
afterwards to the Bertaudi&egrave;re tower, and put him
in a room, which, by order of M. de Saint Mars, I
had furnished before his arrival."</p>

<p>Throughout the life of this mysterious personage
in the Bastille, the secrecy which had so far
environed him was rigidly observed. So far as is
known, no one ever saw him without his mask.
Aside from this, and his detention, everything that
could be was done to make his life enjoyable. He
was given the best accommodation the Bastille
afforded. Nothing that he desired was refused him.
He had a strong taste for lace and linen of extreme
fineness, and his wishes in this particular were complied
with. His table was always served in the
most elegant manner, while the governor, who
frequently attended him, seldom sat in his presence.</p>

<p>During his intervals of ailment he was attended
by the old doctor of the Bastille, who, while often
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
examining his tongue and parts of his body, never
saw his face. He represents him as very finely
shaped, and of somewhat brownish complexion,
with an agreeable and engaging voice. He never
complained, nor gave any hint as to who he was,
and throughout his whole prison life no one gained
the least clue to his identity. The only instance
in which he attempted to make himself known is
described by Voltaire, who tells us that while at
Sainte Marguerite he threw out from the grated
window of his cell a piece of fine linen, and a silver
plate on which he had traced some strange characters.
This, however, is an unauthenticated story.</p>

<p>The detention of this mysterious prisoner in the
Bastille was not an extended one. He died in 1703.
Dujunca's journal tells the story of his death. "On
Monday, the 19th of November, 1703, the unknown
prisoner, who had continually worn a black
velvet mask, and whom M. de Saint Mars had
brought with him from the island of Sainte Marguerite,
died to-day at about ten o'clock in the
evening, having been yesterday taken slightly ill.
He had been a long time in M. de Saint Mars'
hands, and his illness was exceedingly trifling."</p>

<p>There is one particular of interest in this record.
The "iron mask" appears to have been really a
mask of black velvet, the only iron about it being
the springs, which permitted the lower part to be
lifted.</p>

<p>The question now arises, Who was the "man with
the iron mask"? It is a question which has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
long debated, without definite conclusion. Chamillard
was the last minister of Louis XIV. who knew
this secret. When he was dying, his son-in-law,
Marshal de Feuillade, begged him on his knees to
reveal the mystery. He begged in vain. Chamillard
answered that it was a secret of state, which
he had sworn never to reveal, and he died with it
untold.</p>

<p>Voltaire, in his "Age of Louis XIV.," was the
first to call special attention to this mystery, and
since then numerous conjectures have been made as
to who the Iron Mask really was. One writer has
suggested that he was an illegitimate son of Anne
of Austria, the queen-mother. Another identifies
him with a supposed twin brother of Louis XIV.,
whose birth Richelieu had concealed. Others make
him the Count of Vermandois, an illegitimate son
of Louis XIV.; the Duke of Beaufort, a hero of the
Fronde; the Duke of Monmouth, the English pretender
of 1685; Fouquet, Louis's disgraced minister
of finance; a son of Cromwell, the English protector;
and various other wild and unfounded
guesses. After all has been said, the identity of the
prisoner remains unknown. Mattioli, a diplomatic
agent of the Duke of Mantua, who was long imprisoned
at Pignerol and at Sainte Marguerite, was
for a long time generally thought to be the Iron
Mask, but there is good reason to believe that he
died in 1694.</p>

<p>Conjecture has exhausted itself, and yet the identity
of this strange captive remains a mystery, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
is likely always to continue so. The fact that all
the exalted personages of the day can be traced
renders it probable that the veiled prisoner was
really an obscure individual, whom the caprice
of Louis XIV. surrounded with conditions intended
to excite the curiosity of the public. There are on
record other instances of imprisonment under similar
conditions of inviolate secrecy, and it is not impossible
that the king may have endeavored, for no
purpose higher than whim, to surround the story
of this one with unbroken mystery. If such were
his purpose it has succeeded, for there is no more
mysterious person in history than the Man with the
Iron Mask.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a>
</span><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-24" id="h2-24"></a><h2><i>VOLTAIRE'S LAST VISIT
TO PARIS.</i></h2>

<p>Never had excitable Paris been more excited.
Only one man was talked of, only one subject
thought of; there was no longer interest in rumors
of war, in political quarrels, in the doings at the
king's court; all admiration and all sympathy
were turned towards one feeble old man, who had
returned to Paris to die. For twenty-seven years
he had been absent, that brilliant writer and unsurpassed
genius, the versatile Voltaire. His facile
pen had given its greatest glory to the reign of
Louis XV., yet for more than a quarter of a century
he had been exiled from the land he loved,
because he dared to exercise the privilege of free
speech in that land of oppression, and to deal with
kings and nobles as man with man, not as reverent
worshipper with divinity. Now, in his eighty-fourth
year of age, he had ventured to come back
to the city he loved above all others, with scarcely
enough life left for the journey, and far from sure
that power would not still seek to suppress genius
as it had done in the past.</p>

<p>If he had such fears, there was no warrant for
them. Paris was ready to worship him. The king
himself would not have dared to interfere with the
popular idol in that interval of enthusiastic ebullition.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
All Paris was prepared to cast itself at his
feet; all France was eager to do him honor; all
calumny, jealousy, hatred were forgotten; a nation
had risen to welcome and honor its greatest genius,
and the splendors of the court paled before the glory
which seemed to emanate from that feeble, tottering
veteran of the empire of thought, who had come
back to occupy, for a brief period, the throne of his
old dominion.</p>

<p>The admiration, the enthusiasm, the glory were
too much for him. He was dying in the excitement
of joy and triumph. Yet, with his wonderful
elasticity of frame and mind, he rose again for a
fuller enjoyment of that popular ovation which was
to him the wine of life. The story of his final
triumph has been so graphically told by an eye-witness
that we cannot do better than to quote
his words.</p>

<p>"M. de Voltaire has appeared for the first time
at the Academy and at the play; he found all the
doors, all the approaches, to the Academy besieged
by a multitude which only opened slowly to let him
pass, and then rushed in immediately upon his
footsteps with repeated plaudits and acclamations.
The Academy came out into the first room to meet
him, an honor it had never yet paid to any of its
members, not even to the foreign princes who had
deigned to be present at its meetings.</p>

<p>"The homage he received at the Academy was
merely the prelude to that which awaited him at
the National theatre. As soon as his carriage was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
seen at a distance, there arose a universal shout of
joy. All the curb-stones, all the barriers, all the
windows, were crammed with spectators, and
scarcely was the carriage stopped when people were
already on the imperial and even on the wheels to
get a nearer view of the divinity. Scarcely had
he entered the house when Sieur Brizard came up
with a crown of laurels, which Madame de Villette
placed upon the great man's head, but which he
immediately took off, though the public urged him
to keep it on by clapping of hands and by cheers
which resounded from all parts of the house with
such a din as never was heard.</p>

<span class="caption">VOLTAIRE&#39;S LAST VISIT TO PARIS.</span></div>

<p>"All the women stood up. I saw at one time
that part of the pit which was under the boxes go
down on their knees, in despair of getting a sight
any other way. The whole house was darkened
with the dust raised by the ebb and flow of the
excited multitude. It was not without difficulty
that the players managed at last to begin the piece.
It was 'Irene,' which was given for the sixth time.
Never had this tragedy been better played, never
less listened to, never more applauded. The illustrious
old man rose to thank the public, and, a
moment afterwards, there appeared on a pedestal
in the middle of the stage a bust of this great man,
and the actresses, garlands and crowns in hand,
covered it with laurels.</p>

<p>"M. de Voltaire seemed to be sinking beneath the
burden of age and of the homage with which he
had just been overwhelmed. He appeared deeply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
affected, his eyes still sparkled amidst the pallor
of his face, but it seemed as if he breathed no
longer save with the consciousness of his glory.
The people shouted, 'Lights! lights! that everybody
may see him!' The coachman was entreated
to go at a walk, and thus he was accompanied by
cheering and the crowd as far as Pont Royal."</p>

<p>This was a very different greeting from that which
Voltaire had received fifty years before, when a
nobleman with whom he had quarrelled had him
beaten with sticks in the public street, and, when
Voltaire showed an intention of making him answer
at the sword's point for this outrage, had him seized
and thrown into the Bastille by the authorities.
This was but one of the several times he had been
immured in this gloomy prison for daring to say
what he thought about powers and potentates. But
time brings its revenges. The Chevalier de Rohan,
who had had the poet castigated, was forgotten except
as the man who had dishonored himself in
seeking to dishonor Voltaire, and the poet had
become the idol of the people of Paris, high and low
alike.</p>

<p>Voltaire was not the only great man in Paris at
this period. There was another as great as he, but
great in a very different fashion,&mdash;Benjamin
Franklin, the American philosopher and statesman,
as famous for common sense and public spirit
as Voltaire was for poetical power and satirical
keenness. These two great men met, and their
meeting is worthy of description. The American
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
envoys had asked permission to call on the veteran
of literature, a request that was willingly granted
when Voltaire learned that Franklin was one of the
number. What passed between them may be briefly
related.</p>

<p>They found the aged poet reclining on a couch,
thin of body, wrinkled of face, evidently sick and
feeble; yet his eyes, "glittering like two carbuncles,"
showed what spirit lay within his withered
frame. As they entered, he raised himself with
difficulty, and repeated the following lines from
Thomson's "Ode to Liberty," a poem which he had
been familiar with in England fifty years before.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-4">"Lo! swarming southward on rejoicing suns,<br /></span>
<span>Gay colonies extend, the calm retreat<br /></span>
<span>Of undisturbed Distress, the better home<br /></span>
<span>Of those whom bigots chase from foreign lands;<br /></span>
<span>Not built on rapine, servitude, and woe,<br /></span>
<span>And in their turn some petty tyrant's prey;<br /></span>
<span>But bound by social Freedom, firm they rise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He then began to converse with Franklin in English;
but, on being asked by his niece to speak in
French, that she and others present might understand
what was said, he remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I have, for the moment,
yielded to the vanity of showing that I can speak
in the language of a Franklin."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Dr. Franklin presented him
his grandson, whereupon the old man lifted his
hands over the head of the youth, and said, "My
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
child, God and liberty! Recollect those two words."
</p>
<p>This was not the only scene between Franklin and
Voltaire. Another took place at the Academy of
Sciences at one of the meetings of that body. The
two distinguished guests sat side by side on the
platform, in full view of the audience.</p>

<p>During the proceedings an interruption occurred.
A confused cry arose, the names of the two great
visitors alone being distinguishable. It was taken
to mean that they should be introduced. This was
done. They rose and acknowledged the courtesy
by bowing and a few words. But such a formal
proceeding was far from enough to satisfy the audience.
The noise continued. Franklin and Voltaire
shook hands. This gave rise to plaudits, but
the confused cries were not stilled; the audience
wanted some more decided demonstration.</p>

<p>"Il faut s'embrasser, &agrave; la Fran&ccedil;oise" ["You
must embrace, in French fashion"], they cried.</p>

<p>John Adams, who witnessed the spectacle, thus
describes what followed: "The two aged actors
upon this great theatre of philosophy and frivolity,
embraced each other by hugging one another in their
arms, and kissing each other's cheeks, and then the
tumult subsided. And the cry immediately spread
through the whole kingdom, and, I suppose over
all Europe, 'How charming it was to see Solon
and Sophocles embrace.'"</p>

<p>A month later Voltaire lay dead, his brilliant eyes
closed, his active brain at rest. The excitement of
his visit to Paris and the constant ovation which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
had received had been too much for the old man.
He had died in the midst of his triumph, vanished
from the stage of life just when his genius had
compelled the highest display of appreciation which
it was possible for his countrymen to give. As for
the church, which his keen pen had dealt with as
severely as with the temporal powers, it could not
well forget his incessant and bitter attacks. That
he might obtain Christian burial, he confessed and
received absolution from the Abb&eacute; Gaultier; but,
with his views, this was simply a sacrifice to the
proprieties; he remained a heathen poet to the end,
a born satirist and scoffer at all tradition and all
conventionality.</p>

<p>Voltaire was deistic in belief, in no sense atheistic.
Among his latest words were, "I die worshipping
God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies,
but detesting superstition." Despite the admiration
of the people, the powers of the state could
not forget that the man so enthusiastically received
was the great apostle of mockery and irreverence.
The government gave its last kick to the dead lion
by ordering the papers not to comment on his
death. The church laid an interdict on his burial
in consecrated ground,&mdash;an hour or two too late,
as it proved. His body, minus the heart, was transferred
in 1791 to the Pantheon, and when, in 1864,
the sarcophagus was opened with the purpose of
restoring the heart to the other remains, it was
found to be empty. In the stirring days of France
the body had by some one, in some way, been
removed.

<a name="h2-25" id="h2-25"></a><h2><i>THE DIAMOND NECKLACE.</i></h2>

<p>Paris, that city of sensations, was shaken to its
centre by tidings of a new and startling event. The
Cardinal de Rohan, grand almoner of France, at
mass-time, and when dressed in his pontifical robes,
had been suddenly arrested in the palace of Versailles
and taken to the Bastille. Why? No one
knew; though many had their opinions and beliefs.
Rumors of some mysterious and disgraceful secret
beneath this arrest, a mystery in which the honor
of Marie Antoinette, the queen of France, was involved,
had got afloat, and were whispered from end
to end of the city, in which "the Austrian," as the
queen was contemptuously designated, was by no
means a favorite.</p>

<p>The truth gradually came out,&mdash;the story of a
disgraceful and extraordinary intrigue, of which the
prince cardinal was a victim rather than an accessory,
and of which the queen was utterly ignorant,
though the odium of the transaction clung to her
until her death. When, eight years afterwards, she
was borne through a raging mob to the guillotine,
insulting references to this affair of the diamond
necklace were among the terms of opprobrium heaped
upon her by the dregs of the Parisian populace.</p>

<p>What was this disgraceful business? It is partly
revealed in the graphic account of an interview with
the king which preceded the arrest of the prince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
cardinal. On the 15th of August, 1785, Louis XVI.
sent for M. de Rohan to his cabinet. He entered
smilingly, not dreaming of the thunderbolt that was
about to burst upon his head. He found there the
king and queen, the former with indignant countenance,
the latter grave and severe in expression.</p>

<p>"Cardinal," broke out the king, in an abrupt
tone, "you bought some diamonds of Boehmer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," rejoined the cardinal, disturbed by
the stern severity of the king's looks and tone.</p>

<p>"What have you done with them?"</p>

<p>"I thought they had been sent to the queen."</p>

<p>"Who gave you the commission to buy them?"</p>

<p>"A lady, the Countess de La Motte Valois," answered
the cardinal, growing more uneasy. "She
gave me a letter from the queen; I thought I was
obliging her Majesty."</p>

<p>The queen sharply interrupted him. She was no
friend of the cardinal; he had maligned her years
before, when her husband was but dauphin of
France. Now was the opportunity to repay him for
those malevolent letters.</p>

<p>"How, sir," she broke out severely; "how could
you think&mdash;you to whom I have never spoken for
eight years&mdash;that I should choose <i>you</i> for conducting
such a negotiation, and by the medium of such
a woman?"</p>

<p>"I was mistaken, I perceive," said the cardinal,
humbly. "The desire I felt to please your Majesty
misled me. Here is the letter which I was told
was from you."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew a letter from his pocket and handed it
to the king. Louis took it, and cast his eyes over
the signature. He looked up indignantly.</p>

<p>"How could a prince of your house and my grand
almoner suppose that the queen would sign, 'Marie
Antoinette of France?'" he sternly demanded.
"Queens do not sign their names at such length.
It is not even the queen's writing. And what is
the meaning of all these doings with jewellers, and
these notes shown to bankers?"</p>

<p>By this time the cardinal was so agitated that he
was obliged to rest himself against the table for
support.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, in a broken voice, "I am too much
overcome to be able to reply. What you say overwhelms
me with surprise."</p>

<p>"Walk into the room, cardinal," said the king,
with more kindness of tone. "You may write your
explanation of these occurrences."</p>

<p>The cardinal attempted to do so, but his written
statement failed to make clear the mystery. In the
end an officer of the king's body-guard was called
in, and an order given him to convey Cardinal de
Rohan to the Bastille. He had barely time to give
secret directions to his grand vicar to burn all his
papers, before he was carried off to that frightful
fortress, the scene of so much injustice, haunted
by so many woes.</p>

<p>The papers of De Rohan probably needed purging
by fire, for the order to burn them indicates that
they contained evidence derogatory to his position
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
as a dignitary of the church. The prince cardinal
was a vain and profligate man, full of vicious
inclinations, and credulous to a degree that had
made him the victim of the unscrupulous schemer,
Madame de La Motte Valois, a woman as adroit
and unscrupulous as she was daring. Of low birth,
brought up by charity, married to a ruined nobleman,
she had ended her career by duping and ruining
Cardinal de Rohan, a man whose character
exposed him to the machinations of an adventuress
so skilful, bold, and alluring as La Motte Valois.</p>

<p>So much for preliminary. Let us take up the
story at its beginning. The diamond necklace was
an exceedingly handsome and highly valuable piece
of jewelry, containing about five hundred diamonds,
and held at a price equal to about four hundred
thousand dollars of modern money. It had been
made by Boehmer, a jeweller of Paris, about the
year 1774, and was intended for Madame Dubarry,
the favorite of Louis XV. But before the necklace
was finished Louis had died, and a new king had
come to the throne. With Louis XVI. virtue entered
that profligate court, and Madame Dubarry
was excluded from its precincts. As for the necklace,
it remained without a purchaser. It was too
costly for a subject, and was not craved by the
queen. The jeweller had not failed to offer it to
Marie Antoinette, but found her disinclined to buy.
The American Revolution was going on, France
was involved in the war, and money was needed
for other purposes than diamond necklaces.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p274" id="p274"></a>
<img src="images/p274.jpg" alt="MARIE ANTOINETTE AND HER CHILDREN." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">MARIE ANTOINETTE AND HER CHILDREN.</span></div>

<p>"That is the price of two frigates," said the king,
on hearing of the estimated value of the famous
trinket.</p>

<p>"We want ships, and not diamonds," said the
queen, and ended the audience with the jeweller.</p>

<p>A few months afterwards, M. Boehmer openly
declared that he had found a purchaser for the
necklace. It had gone to Constantinople, he said,
for the adornment of the favorite sultana.</p>

<p>"This was a real pleasure to the queen," says
Madame Campan. "She, however, expressed some
astonishment that a necklace made for the adornment
of French women should be worn in the
seraglio, and, thereupon, she talked to me a long
time about the total change which took place in the
tastes and desires of women in the period between
twenty and thirty years of age. She told me that
when she was ten years younger she loved diamonds
madly, but that she had no longer any taste for anything
but private society, the country, the work and
the attentions required by the education of her children.
From that moment until the fatal crisis
there was nothing more said about the necklace."</p>

<p>The necklace had not been sold. It remained in
the jeweller's hands until nearly ten years had
passed. Then the vicious De La Motte laid an
adroit plan for getting it into her possession,
through the aid of the Cardinal de Rohan, who
had come to admire her. She was a hanger-on of
the court, and began her work by persuading the
cardinal that the queen regarded him with favor.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
The credulous dupe was completely infatuated with
the idea. One night, in August, 1784, he was given
a brief interview in the groves around Versailles
with a woman whom he supposed to be the queen,
but who was really a girl resembling her, and taught
by La Motte to play this part.</p>

<p>Filled with the idea that the queen loved him, the
duped cardinal was ready for any folly. De La
Motte played her next card by persuading him that
the queen had a secret desire to possess this wonderful
necklace, but had not the necessary money
at that time. She would, however, sign an agreement
to purchase it if the cardinal would become
her security. De Rohan eagerly assented. This
secret understanding seemed but another proof of
the queen's predilection for him. An agreement
was produced, signed with the queen's name, to
which the cardinal added his own, and on February
1, 1785, the jeweller surrendered the necklace to
De Rohan, receiving this agreement as his security.
The cardinal carried the costly prize to Versailles,
where he was told the queen would send for it. It
was given by him to La Motte, who was commissioned
to deliver it to her royal patroness. In a few
days afterwards this lady's husband disappeared
from Paris, and the diamond necklace with him.</p>

<p>The whole affair had been a trick. All the messages
from the queen had been false ones, the written
documents being prepared by a seeming valet,
who was skilful in the imitation of handwriting.
Throughout the whole business the cardinal had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
been readily deceived, infatuation closing his eyes
to truth.</p>

<p>Such was the first act in the drama. The second
opened when the jeweller began to press for payment.
M. de La Motte sold some of the diamonds
in England, and transmitted the money to his wife,
who is said to have quieted the jeweller for a time
by paying him some instalments on the price. But
he quickly grew impatient and suspicious that all
was not right, and went to court, where he earnestly
inquired if the necklace had been delivered to the
queen. For a time she could not understand what
he meant. The diamond necklace? What diamond
necklace? What did this mean? The Cardinal de
Rohan her security for payment!&mdash;it was all false,
all base, some dark intrigue behind it all.</p>

<p>Burning with indignation, she sent for Abb&eacute; de
Vermond and Baron de Breteuil, the minister of the
king's household, and told them of the affair. It
was a shameful business, they said. They hated
the cardinal, and did not spare him. The queen,
growing momentarily more angry, at length decided
to reveal the whole transaction to the king, and
roused in his mind an indignation equal to her
own. The result we have already seen. De Rohan
and La Motte were consigned to the Bastille. M. de
La Motte was in England, and thus out of reach of
justice. Another celebrated individual who was
concerned in the affair, and had aided in duping
the cardinal, the famous, or infamous, Count Cagliostro,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
was also consigned to the Bastille for his share
in the dark and deep intrigue.</p>

<p>The trial came on, as the closing act in this
mysterious drama, in which all Paris had now
become intensely interested. The cardinal had
renounced all the privileges of his rank and condition,
and accepted the jurisdiction of Parliament,&mdash;perhaps
counting on the open enmity between
that body and the court.</p>

<p>The trial revealed a disgraceful business, in which
a high dignitary of the church had permitted himself
to be completely gulled by a shameless woman
and the equally shameless Cagliostro, and into which
not only the name but even the virtue of the queen
had been dragged. Public opinion became intense.
The hostility to the queen which had long smouldered
now openly declared itself. "It was for her
and by her orders that the necklace was bought,"
said the respectable Parisians. Those who were not
respectable said much worse things. The queen
was being made a victim of these shameless and
criminal adventurers.</p>

<p>The trial went on, political feeling being openly
displayed in it. The great houses of Cond&eacute; and
Rohan took sides with the cardinal. Their representatives
might be seen, dressed in mourning, interviewing
the magistrates on their way to the
tribunal, pleading with them on behalf of their
relative. The magistrates needed little persuasion.
The Parliament of Paris had long been at sword's
point with the crown; now was its time for revenge;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
political prejudice blinded the members to the pure
questions of law and justice; the cardinal was
acquitted.</p>

<p>Cagliostro was similarly acquitted. He had conducted
his own case, and with a skill that deceived
the magistrates and the public alike. Madame de
La Motte alone was convicted. She was sentenced
to be whipped, branded on each shoulder with the
letter V (for <i>voleuse</i>, "thief"), and to be imprisoned
for life. Her husband, who was in England,
was sentenced in his absence to the galleys for life.
A minor participant in this business, the girl who
had personated the queen, escaped unpunished.</p>

<p>So ended this disgraceful affair. The queen was
greatly cast down by the result. "Condole with
me," she said, in a broken voice, to Madame Campan;
"the intriguer who wanted to ruin me, or
procure money by using my name and forging my
signature, has just been fully acquitted." But it
was due, she declared, to bribery on the part of some
and to political passion on that of others, with an
audacity towards authority which such people loved
to display. The king entered as she was speaking.</p>

<p>"You find the queen in great affliction," he said
to Madame Campan; "she has much reason to be.
But what then? They would not see in this business
anything save a prince of the Church and the
Prince of Rohan, whereas it is only the case of a
man in want of money, and a mere trick for raising
cash, wherein the cardinal has been swindled in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
turn. Nothing is easier to understand, and it needs
no Alexander to cut this Gordian knot."</p>

<p>Cardinal Rohan was exiled to his abbey of Chaise-Dieu,
guilty in the king's opinion, a dupe in the
judgment of history, evidently a credulous profligate
who had mistaken his vocation. The queen
was the true victim of the whole affair. It doubled
the hostility of the people to her, and had its share
in that final sentence which brought her head to the
block.<br /><br /><br /></p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<a name="h2-26" id="h2-26"></a><h2><i>THE FALL OF THE BASTILLE.</i></h2>

<p>"To the Bastille! to the Bastille!" was the cry.
Paris surged with an ungovernable mob. Month
by month, week by week, day by day, since the
meeting of the States-General,&mdash;called into being
chiefly to provide money for the king and kept in
being to provide government for the people,&mdash;the
revolutionary feeling had grown, alike among the
delegates and among the citizens. Now the population
of Paris was aroused, the unruly element of
the city was in the streets, their wrath directed
against the prison-fortress, the bulwark of feudalism,
the stronghold of oppression, the infamous
keeper of the dark secrets of the kings of France.
The people had always feared, always hated it, and
now against its sullen walls was directed the torrent
of their wrath.</p>

<p>The surging throng besieged the H&ocirc;tel de Ville,
demanding arms. Gaining no satisfaction there,
they rushed to the Invalides, where they knew that
arms were stored. The governor wished to parley.
"He asks for time to make us lose ours!" cried
a voice in the crowd. A rush was made, the iron
gates gave way, the cellar-doors were forced open,
and in a short time thirty thousand guns were distributed
among the people.</p>

<p>Minute by minute the tumult increased. Messengers
came with threatening tidings. "The troops
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
are marching to attack the Faubourgs; Paris is
about to be put to fire and sword; the cannon
of the Bastille are about to open fire upon us," were
the startling cries. The people grew wild with
rage.</p>

<p>This scene was the first of those frightful outbreaks
of mob violence of which Paris was in the
coming years to see so many. It was the 14th of
July, 1789. As yet no man dreamed of the horrors
which the near future was to bring forth. The
Third Estate was at war with the king, and fancied
itself the power in France. But beneath it, unseen
by it, almost undreamed of by it, was rousing from
sleep the wild beast of popular fury and revenge.
Centuries of oppression were about to be repaid
by years of a wild carnival of slaughter.</p>

<p>The Bastille was the visible emblem of that
oppression. It was an armed fortress threatening
Paris. The cannon on its walls frowned defiance to
the people. Momentarily the wrath of the multitude
grew stronger. The electors of the Third Estate
sent a message to Delaunay, governor of the Bastille,
asking him to withdraw the cannons, the
sight of which infuriated the people, and promising,
if he would do this, to restrain the mob.</p>

<p>The advice was wise; the governor was not. The
messengers were long absent; the electors grew
uneasy; the tumult in the street increased. At
length the deputation returned, bringing word that
the governor pledged himself not to fire on the
people, unless forced to do so in self-defence. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
message the electors communicated to the crowd
around the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, hoping that it would
satisfy them. Their words were interrupted by a
startling sound, the roar of a cannon,&mdash;even while
they were reporting the governor's evasive message
the cannon of the Bastille were roaring defiance to
the people of Paris! An attack had been made by
the people on the fortress and this was the governor's
response.</p>

<p>That shot was fatal to Delaunay. The citizens
heard it with rage. "Treason!" was the cry.
"To the Bastille! to the Bastille!" again rose the
shout. Surging onward in an irresistible mass, the
furious crowd poured through the streets, and soon
surrounded the towering walls of the detested
prison-fortress. A few bold men had already cut
the chains of the first drawbridge, and let it fall.
Across it rushed the multitude to attack the second
bridge.</p>

<p>The fortress was feebly garrisoned, having but
thirty Swiss soldiers and eighty invalids for its
defence. But its walls were massive; it was well
provided; it had resisted many attacks in the past;
this disorderly and badly-armed mass seemed likely
to beat in vain against those century-old bulwarks
and towers. Yet there come times in which indignation
grows strong, even with bare hands, oppression
waxes weak behind its walls of might, and this
was one of those times.</p>

<p>A chance shot was fired from the crowd; the soldiers
answered with a volley; several men were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
wounded; other shots came from the people; the
governor gave orders to fire the cannon; the struggle
had begun.</p>

<p>It proved a short one. Companies of the National
Guard were brought up to restrain the mob,&mdash;the
soldiers broke from their ranks and joined
it. Two of their sub-officers, Elie and Hullin by
name, put themselves at the head of the furious
crowd and led the people to the assault on the fortress.
The fire of the garrison swept through their
dense ranks; many of them fell; one hundred
and fifty were killed or wounded; but now several
pieces of cannon were dragged up by hand and
their threatening muzzles turned against the gates.</p>

<p>The assault was progressing; Delaunay waited
for succor which did not arrive; the small garrison
could not withstand that mighty mob; in the excitement
of the moment the governor attempted to
blow up the powder magazine, and would have done
so had not one of his attendants held his arms by
force.</p>

<p>And now deputations arrived from the electors,
two of them in succession, demanding that the fortress
should be given up to the citizen guard. Delaunay
proposed to capitulate, saying that he would
yield if he and his men were allowed to march out
with arms and honor. The proposition was received
with shouts of sarcastic laughter.</p>

<p>"Life and safety are all we can promise you,"
answered Elie. "This I engage on the word of an
officer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>Delaunay at this ordered the second drawbridge
to be lowered and the gates to be opened. In
poured the mass, precipitating themselves in fury
upon that hated fortress, rushing madly through all
its halls and passages, breaking its cell-doors with
hammer blows, releasing captives some of whom had
been held there in hopeless misery for half a lifetime,
unearthing secrets which added to their
revengeful rage.</p>

<p>Elie and Hullin had promised the governor his
life. They miscalculated their power over their
savage followers. Before they had gone far they
were fighting hand to hand with the multitude for
the safety of their prisoner. At the Place de
Gr&egrave;ve, Hullin seized the governor in his strong arms
and covered his bare head with a hat, with the hope
of concealing his features from the people. In a
moment more he was hurled down and trodden
under foot, and on struggling to his feet saw the
head of Delaunay carried on a pike. The major
and lieutenant were similarly massacred. Flesselles,
the mayor of Paris, shared their fate. The
other prisoners were saved by the soldiers, who
surrounded and protected them from the fury of
the mob.</p>

<p>The fall of the Bastille was celebrated by two
processions that moved through the streets; one
blood-stained and horrible, carrying the heads of
the victims on pikes; the other triumphant and
pathetic, bearing on their shoulders the prisoners
released from its cells. Of these, two had been incarcerated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
so long that they were imbecile, and no
one could tell whence they came. On the pathway
of this procession flowers and ribbons were scattered.
The spectators looked on with silent horror at the
other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the king was at Versailles, in ignorance
of what was taking place at Paris. The courts
were full of soldiers, drinking and singing; wine
had been distributed among them; there were courtiers
and court intrigues still; the lowering cloud
of ruin had yet scarcely cast a shadow on the
palace. Louis XVI. went to bed and to sleep, in
blissful ignorance of what had taken place. The
Duke of Lioncourt entered and had him awakened,
and informed him of the momentous event.</p>

<p>"But that is a revolt!" exclaimed the king, with
startled face, sitting up on his couch.</p>

<p>"No, sire," replied the duke; "it is a revolution!"</p>

<p>That was the true word. It was a revolution.
With the taking of the Bastille the Revolution of
France was fairly inaugurated. As for that detested
fortress, its demolition began on the next
day, amid the thunder of cannon and the singing
of the <i>Te Deum</i>. It had dominated Paris, and
served as a state-prison for four hundred years. Its
site was henceforward to be kept as a monument
to liberty.

<a name="h2-27" id="h2-27"></a><h2><i>THE STORY OF
THE SAINTE AMPOULE.</i></h2>

<p>Sad years were they for kings and potentates in
France&mdash;now a century ago&mdash;when the cup of civilization
was turned upside-down and the dregs rose to
the top. For once in the history of mankind the
anarchist was lord&mdash;and a frightful use he made of
his privileges. Not only living kings were at a
discount, but the very bones of kings were scattered
to the winds, and the sacred oil, the "Sainte
Ampoule," which for many centuries had been used
at the coronation of the kings of France, became
an object of detestation, and was treated with the
same lack of ceremony and consideration as the
royal family itself.</p>

<p>Thereby hangs a tale. But before telling what
desecration came to the Sainte Ampoule through
the impious hands of the new lords of France, it
may be well to trace briefly the earlier history of
this precious oil. Christianity came to France when
Clovis, its first king, was baptized. And although
we cannot say much for the Christian virtues of the
worthy king Clovis, we are given to understand that
Heaven smiled on his conversion, for the story goes
that a dove came down from the realm of the
blessed, bearing a small vial of holy oil, which was
placed in the hands of St. Remy to be used in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
anointing the king at his coronation. Afterwards
the saint placed this vial in his own tomb, where
it was after many years discovered by miracle. It
is true, St. Remy tells us none of this. Our authority
for it is Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, who
flourished four centuries after Clovis and his converter
had been gathered to their fathers. But as
Hincmar defied those who doubted the story of
the dove and the vial to prove the contrary, and
produced a vial of oil from the saint's tomb in
further proof of his statement, no reasonable person&mdash;at
that day&mdash;could longer deny it, though the
first mention of it is by a chronicler who lived a
century and a half after the saint.</p>

<p>From the days of Hincmar forward the monarchs
of France, at their coronation, were anointed
with this holy oil. And as the dove was said to
have descended at Rheims, and St. Remy was
buried there, this became the city of the coronation.
An order of knighthood was founded to take part
in the coronation,&mdash;the "Knights of the Sainte
Ampoule,"&mdash;but the worthy incumbents held their
office for a day only,&mdash;that of the crowning of the
king. They were created for that purpose, received
the precious vial from the archbishop, and after the
ceremony returned it to that high dignitary of the
church and saw it restored to its abiding-place.
This done, they ceased to exist as knights of
the holy oil, the order dying while the king lived.</p>

<p>But these short-lived chevaliers made the most of
their opportunity, and crowded all the splendor and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289</a></span>
dignity into their one day that it would well bear.
The sacred vial was kept in the abbey of St. Remy,
and from that place to the cathedral they moved in
a stately procession that almost threw the cortege
of the king into the shade. The Grand Prior of St.
Remy bore the vial, in its case or shrine, which hung
from his neck by a golden chain. He rode always
on a white horse, being covered by a magnificent
canopy, upheld by the knights of the Sainte Ampoule.
The cathedral reached, the prior placed the
vial in the hands of the archbishop, who pledged
himself by a solemn oath to restore it at the end
of the ceremony. And to make this doubly sure
a number of barons were given to the knights as
hostages, the restoration of the vial to be their
ransom. The ceremony over, back to the abbey
they went, through streets adorned with rich tapestries,
and surrounded by throngs of admiring
lookers-on, to whom the vial was of as much interest
as the king's crown.</p>

<p>For many centuries this honor came at intervals
to the city of Rheims, and the St. Remy vial figured
as an indispensable element of every kingly coronation.
It figured thus in the mission of Joan of
Arc, whose purpose was to drive the English from
Orleans and open the way to Rheims, that the new
king might be crowned with the old ceremony.
The holy oil continued to play a leading part in the
coronation of the kings until the reign of Louis
XVI. Then came the Revolution, that mighty
overturner of all things sacred and time-honored,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and a new chapter was written in the story of the
Sainte Ampoule. It is this chapter which we have
now to give.</p>

<p>The Revolution had gone on, desecrating things
sacred and beheading things royal, through years
of terror, and now had arrived the 6th of October,
1793, a day fatal in the history of the holy oil. On
that day Citizen Rhul, one of the new sovereigns
of France, entered the room of Philippe Hourelle,
chief <i>marguillier</i> of the Cathedral of Rheims, and
demanded of him the vial of coronation oil of which
he had charge. Horror seized Monsieur Philippe;
but Master Rhul was imperative, and the guillotine
stood in the near perspective. There was
nothing to do but to obey.</p>

<p>"It is not in my care," declared the trembling
Philippe. "It is in the keeping of the cur&eacute;, Monsieur
Seraine. I will instantly apply to him for it."</p>

<p>"And make haste," said Citizen Rhul. "Bring
pomatum and all," thus irreverently designating
the age-thickened oil.</p>

<p>"May I ask what you will do with it?" ventured
Philippe.</p>

<p>"Grease the knife of the guillotine, mayhap,
that it may the easier slip through your neck, if
you waste any time in your errand."</p>

<p>As may be imagined, Philippe Hourelle lost no
time in seeking the cur&eacute;, and giving him his startling
message. M. Seraine heard him with horror.
Had the desecration of sans-culottisme proceeded
so far as this? But an idea sprang to the quick
wit of the cur&eacute;.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can save some of it," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>A minute sufficed to extract a portion of the
unguent-like substance. Then, with a sigh of
regret, the cur&eacute; handed the vial to Philippe, who,
with another sigh of regret, delivered it to Citizen
Rhul, who, without a sigh of regret, carried it to
the front of the cathedral, and at the foot of the
statue of Louis XV. hammered the vial to powder,
and trod what remained of the precious ointment
under foot until it was completely mingled with the
mud of the street.</p>

<p>"So we put an end to princes and pomatum," said
this irascible republican, with a laugh of triumph,
as he ground the remnants of the vial under his
irreverent heel.</p>

<p>Not quite an end to either, as it proved. The
portion of the sacred oil which M. Seraine had
saved was divided into two portions, one kept by
himself, the other placed in the care of Philippe
Hourelle, to be kept until the reign of anarchy
should come to an end and a king reign again in
France. And had Citizen Rhul dreamed of all
that lay in the future every hair on his democratic
head would have stood erect in horror and dismay.</p>

<p>In truth, not many years had passed before the
age of princes came again to France, and a demand
for St. Remy's vial arose, Napoleon was to be
crowned emperor at Notre Dame. Little did this
usurper of royalty care for the holy oil, but there
were those around him with more reverence for the
past, men who would have greatly liked to act as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
knights of the Sainte Ampoule. But the unguent
was not forthcoming, and the emperor was crowned
without its aid.</p>
<p>
Then came the end of the imperial dynasty, and
the return of the Bourbons. To them the precious
ointment was an important essential of legitimate
kingship. Could St. Remy's vial be found, or had
it and its contents vanished in the whirlpool of the
Revolution? That was to be learned. A worthy
magistrate of Rheims, Monsieur de Chevri&egrave;res, took
in hand the task of discovery. He searched diligently
but unsuccessfully, until one day, in the early
months of 1819, when three gentlemen, sons of
Philippe Hourelle, called upon him, and told the
story which we have just transcribed. A portion of
the holy oil of coronation, they declared, had been
in their father's care, preserved and transmitted
through M. Seraine's wit and promptitude. Their
father was dead, but he had left it to his widow,
who long kept it as a priceless treasure. They
were interrupted at this point in their story by
M. de Chevri&egrave;res.</p>

<p>"This is fortunate," he exclaimed. "She must
pass it over to me. Her name will become historic
for her loyal spirit."</p>

<p>"I wish she could," said one of the visitors.
"But, alas! it is lost. Our house was plundered
during the invasion, and among other things taken
was this precious relic. It is irretrievably gone."</p>

<p>That seemed to end the matter; but not so, there
was more of the consecration oil in existence than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
could have been imagined. The visit of the Hourelles
was followed after an interval by a call from
a Judge Lecomte, who brought what he affirmed was
a portion of the holy ointment which had been
given him by the widow Hourelle. Unluckily, it
was of microscopic dimensions, far from enough
to impart the full flavor of kingship to his majesty
Louis XVIII.</p>

<p>It seemed as if this worthy monarch of the Restoration
would have to wear his crown without
anointment, when, fortunately, a new and interesting
item of news was made public. It was declared
by a number of ecclesiastics that the cur&eacute;, M.
Seraine, had given only a part of the oil to Philippe
Hourelle, and had himself kept the remainder.
He had told them so, but, as it proved, not a man
of them all knew what he had done with it. He
had died, and the secret with him. Months passed
away; spring vanished; summer came; then new
tidings bloomed. A priest of Berry-au-Bac, M.
Bour&eacute; by name, sought M. de Chevri&egrave;res, and gladdened
his heart with the announcement that the
missing relic was in his possession, having been
consigned to him by M. Seraine. It was rendered
doubly precious by being wrapped in a portion of
the winding sheet of the blessed St. Remy himself.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Within a week another portion
of the lost treasure was brought forward. It had
been preserved in a manner almost miraculous. Its
possessor was a gentleman named M. Champagne
Provotian, who had the following interesting story
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
to tell. He had, a quarter of a century before, in
1793, been standing near Citizen Rhul when that
scion of the Revolution destroyed the vial of St.
Remy, at the foot of the statue of Louis XV., in
front of the Cathedral of Rheims. When he struck
the vial he did so with such force that fragments
of it flew right and left, some of them falling on
the coat-sleeve of the young man beside him, M.
Champagne. These he dexterously concealed from
the iconoclastic citizen, took home, and preserved.
He now produced them.</p>

<p>Here were three separate portions of the precious
ointment. A commission was appointed to examine
them. They were pronounced genuine, oil and
glass alike. Enough had been saved to crown a
king.</p>

<p>"There is nothing now to obstruct the coronation
of your Majesty," said an officer of the court to
Louis XVIII.</p>

<p>His majesty laughed incredulously. He was an
unbeliever as regarded legend and a democrat as
regarded ceremony, and gave the gentleman to
understand that he was content to reign without
being anointed.</p>

<p>"What shall be done with the ointment?" asked
the disappointed official.</p>

<p>"Lock it up in the vestry and say no more about
it," replied the king.</p>

<p>This was done, and the precious relics were
restored to the tomb of St. Remy, whence they originally
came; being placed there in a silver reliquary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
lined with white silk, and enclosed in a metal case,
with three locks. And there they lay till 1825,
when a new king came to the throne, in the person
of Charles X.</p>

<p>Now, for the last time, the old ceremony was
revived, the knights of the Sainte Ampoule being
created, and their office duly performed. With
such dignity as he could assume and such grandeur
as he could display, Charles entered the choir of
the cathedral and advanced to the grand altar, at
whose foot he knelt. On rising, he was led to the
centre of the sanctuary, and took his seat in a
throne-like chair, placed there to receive him. In a
semi-circle round him stood a richly-dressed group
of nobles and courtiers.</p>

<p>Then came forward in stately procession the
chevaliers of the Sainte Ampoule, bearing the
minute remnants of that sacred oil which was
claimed to have been first used in the anointing
of Clovis, thirteen hundred years before. An imposing
group of churchmen stood ready to receive
the ointment, including three prelates, an archbishop,
and two bishops. These dignitaries carried
the precious relic to the high altar, consecrated it,
and anointed the king with a solemn ceremony
highly edifying to the observers, and greatly gratifying
to the vanity of the new monarch.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that this ceremonious proceeding
appealed to the people of France. It was the
nineteenth century, and the Revolution lay between
the new and the old age. All men of wit laughed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
at the pompous affair, and five years afterwards the
people of Paris dispensed with Charles X. as their
king, despite the flavor of coronation that hung
about him. The dynasty of the Bourbons was at
an end, and the knights of the Saint Ampoule had
been created for the last time.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there is a story connected with
the coronation ceremony which may be of interest.
Legend or history tells us that at one time the English
took the city of Rheims, plundered it, and, as
part of their plunder, carried off the Saint Ampoule,
which their desecrating hands had stolen from the
tomb of St. Remy. The people of the suburb of
Ch&egrave;ne la Populeux pursued the invaders, fell upon
them and recovered this precious treasure. From
that time, in memory of their deed, the inhabitants
of Ch&egrave;ne claimed the right to walk in the procession
of the Sainte Ampoule, and to fall heir to the horse
ridden by the Grand Prior. This horse was furnished
by the government, and was claimed by the
prior as the property of the abbey, in recompense
for his services. He denied the claim of the people
of Ch&egrave;ne, said that their story was a fable, and that
at the best they were but low-born rogues. As a
result of all this, hot blood existed between the
rival claimants to the white horse of the coronation.</p>

<p>At the crowning of Louis XIV. the monks and
the people of Ch&egrave;ne came to blows, in support of
their respective claims. The villagers pulled the
prior from his horse, pummelled the monks who
came to his aid, thrashed the knights out of every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
semblance of dignity, tore the canopy into shreds,
and led off the white horse in triumph. Law followed
blows; the cost of a dozen horses was wasted
on the lawyers; in the end the monks won, and the
people of Ch&egrave;ne had to restore the four-footed prize
to the prior.</p>

<p>At the subsequent coronations of Louis XV. and
Louis XVI. they renewed their claim, and violence
was again threatened. The trouble was overcome
by special decrees, which prohibited the people of
Ch&egrave;ne from meddling with the claim of the prior.
By the time of the coronation of Charles X., all
such medi&aelig;val folly was at an end, and the stately
old ceremony had become a matter of popular
ridicule.</p>

<p>The story of the Sainte Ampoule is not without
its interest in showing the growth of ideas. At the
end of the ninth century, a bishop could gravely
state, and a nation unquestionably accept his statement,
that a dove had flown down from heaven
bearing a vial of holy oil for the anointment of its
kings. At the end of the nineteenth century the
same nation has lost its last vestige of reverence
for the "divinity which doth hedge a king," and
has no longer any use for divinely-commissioned
potentates or heaven-sent ointments.

<a name="h2-28" id="h2-28"></a><h2><i>THE FLIGHT OF THE KING.</i></h2>

<p>At midnight of the 22d of June, 1791, a heavy
and lumbering carriage rolled slowly into the town
of Varennes, situated in the department of Meuse,
in northeastern France. It had set out from Paris
at an early hour of the preceding day, and had now
left that turbulent capital more than a hundred
and fifty miles behind it, pursuing a direct route
towards the nearest frontier of the kingdom.</p>

<p>There were in this clumsy vehicle several plainly-dressed
ladies, a man attired as a servant, and a
half-grown boy. They all seemed in the best of
spirits, and felicitated themselves on having come
so far without question or obstruction. As they
neared Varennes, however, an alarming sound was
borne on the midnight air to their ears,&mdash;that of a
clanging bell, ringing quickly, as if in alarm. They
entered the town and drove to the post-house.</p>

<p>"Let us have horses at once," was the demand
of the outriders; "we must go forward without
delay."</p>

<p>"There are no horses ready," was the reply.
"Have you your passports?"</p>

<p>The papers were presented and taken to M.
Sausse, the public officer of the commune, a timid
little shop-keeper, sadly incompetent to deal with
any matter that needed bold decision. He cast his
eye over the passports, which shook in his trembling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
hand. Yet they appeared to be all right, being
made out in the name of Baron Korf, the man in
the carriage being named as a valet de chambre
to the baron.</p>

<p>But the disturbed little commune officer knew
better than that. A young man named Drouet, son
of the postmaster at St. Menehould, had, a half-hour
or so before, ridden at furious speed into the
town, giving startling information to such of the
citizens as he found awake. There quickly followed
that ringing of the alarm-bell which had
pealed trouble into the ears of the approaching
travellers.</p>

<p>M. Sausse approached the carriage, and bowed
with the deepest respect before the seeming servant
within.</p>

<p>"Will you not enter my house?" he asked.
"There is a rumor abroad that we are so fortunate
as to have our king in our midst. If you remain
in the carriage, while the municipal authorities are
in council, your Majesty might be exposed to
insult."</p>

<p>The secret was out; it was the king of France
who was thus masquerading in the dress of a lackey
and speeding with all haste towards the frontier.
The town was alarmed: a group of armed men stood
at the shopkeeper's door as the traveller entered;
some of them told him rudely that they knew him
to be the king.</p>

<p>"If you recognize him," sharply answered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
lady who followed, "speak to him with the respect
you owe your king."</p>

<p>It was Marie Antoinette, though her dress was
rather that of a waiting-maid than a queen. The
ladies who followed her were Madame Elizabeth,
the princess, and the governess of the royal children.
The boy was the dauphin of France.</p>

<p>This flight had been undertaken under the management
of General Bouill&eacute;, who had done all in his
power to make it successful, by stationing relays of
soldiers along the road, procuring passports, and
other necessary details. But those intrusted with
its execution had, aside from keeping the project a
secret, clumsily managed its details. The carriage
procured was of great size, and loaded like a furniture
van with luggage. There was a day's delay in
the start. Even the setting out was awkwardly
managed; the queen leaving the palace on foot,
losing her way, and keeping her companions perilously
waiting. The detachments of troops on the
road were sure to attract attention. Careful precautions
for the defeat of the enterprise seemed to
have been taken.</p>

<p>Yet all went well until St. Menehould was
reached, though the king was recognized by more
than one person on the road. "We passed through
the large town of Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne," wrote the
young princess, "where we were quite recognized.
Many people praised God at seeing the king, and
made vows for his escape."</p>

<p>All France had not yet reached the republican
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
virulence of Paris. "All goes well, Fran&ccedil;ois," said
the queen in a glad tone to Valory, her courier.
"If we were to have been stopped, it would have
taken place already."</p>

<p>At St. Menehould, however, they found the people
in a different temper. The king was recognized,
and though his carriage was not stopped, a
detachment of dragoons, who had followed him at
a distance, was not suffered to proceed, the people
cutting the girths of the horses. Young Drouet,
of whom we have already spoken, sprang on horseback
and rode hurriedly on towards Varennes, preceding
the carriage.</p>

<p>The soldiers who had been posted at Varennes
were in no condition to assist the king. The son of
Marquis Bouill&eacute;, who had accompanied the royal
party, found them helplessly intoxicated, and rode
off at full speed to inform his father of the alarming
condition of affairs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the king, who had taken refuge in the
shop of the grocer Sausse, awaited the municipal
authorities in no small perturbation of spirits.
They presented themselves at length before him,
bowing with great show of respect, and humbly
asking his orders.</p>

<p>"Have the horses put to my carriage without
delay," he said, with no further attempt at concealment,
"that I may start for Montm&eacute;dy."</p>

<p>They continued respectful, but were provided
with various reasons why they could not obey: the
horses were at a distance; those in the stables were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
not in condition to travel; pretext after pretext
was advanced for delay. In truth, no pretext was
needed; the adjoining street was filled with armed
revolutionists, and in no case would the carriage
have been suffered to proceed.</p>

<p>As daybreak approached a detachment of dragoons
rode into the town. They were those who
had been posted near Ch&acirc;lons, and who had ridden
on towards Montm&eacute;dy after the king's passage.
Missing him, they had returned. Choiseul, their
commander, pushed through the people and entered
the shop.</p>

<p>"You are environed here," he said to the king.
"We are not strong enough to take the carriage
through; but if you will mount on horseback we
can force a passage through the crowd."</p>

<p>"If I were alone I should try it," said Louis.
"I cannot do it as matters stand. I am waiting
for daylight; they do not refuse to let me go on;
moreover, M. de Bouill&eacute; will soon be here."</p>

<p>He did not recognize the danger of delay. The
crowd in the streets was increasing; the bridge was
barricaded; the authorities had sent a messenger
in haste to Paris to tell what had happened and ask
orders from the National Assembly.</p>

<p>"Tell M. de Bouill&eacute; that I am a prisoner," said
the king to Captain Deslon, the commander of a
detachment, who had just reached him. "I suspect
that he cannot do anything for me, but I desire
him to do what he can."</p>

<p>The queen meanwhile was urgently entreating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Madame Sausse to use her influence with her husband
and procure an order for the king's release.
She found the good woman by no means inclined
to favor her.</p>

<p>"You are thinking of the king," she said; "I
am thinking of M. Sausse; each is for her own
husband."</p>

<p>By this time the throng in the streets was growing
impatient and violent. "To Paris! to Paris!"
shouted the people. The king grew frightened.
Bouill&eacute; had failed to appear. There was no indication
of his approach. The excitement grew momentarily
greater.</p>

<p>During this anxious interval two officers rode
rapidly up on the road from Paris, and presented
themselves before the king. They were aides-de-camp
of General Lafayette, commander of the
National Guard. One of them, Romeuf by name,
handed Louis a decree of the assembly ordering
pursuit and return of the king. It cited an act
which forbade any public functionary to remove
himself more than twenty leagues from his post.</p>

<p>"I never sanctioned that," cried the king, angrily,
flinging the paper on the bed where the dauphin
lay.</p>

<p>The queen snatched it up hastily, exclaiming that
the bed of her children should not be soiled by such
a document.</p>

<p>"Madame," said Romeuf, warningly, "do you
wish that other eyes than mine should witness your
anger?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen blushed, and recovered with an effort
the composure which she had suffered herself to
lose.</p>

<p>A messenger now arrived from Bouill&eacute; bringing
word that the detachments he had posted were
moving towards Varennes, and that he himself was
on the way thither. But the tumult in the streets
had grown hour by hour; the people were becoming
furious at the delay; it seemed certain that the
arrival of the troops would be the signal for a battle
with the armed populace, who had strongly barricaded
the town. Utterly disheartened, the king
gave orders for the carriage; he had decided to
return to Paris.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards Bouill&eacute;, breathless from a
long and hurried ride, arrived within sight of
Varennes. Its barricades met his eyes. He was
told that the king had set out on his return an hour
before. The game was up; Louis had lost his last
hope of escape; the loyal general took the road for
Stenay, and that same evening crossed the French
frontier.</p>

<p>The king's carriage made its way back to Paris
through a throng that lined the roads, and which
became dense when the city was reached. The
National Guards held their arms reversed; none of
the spectators uncovered their heads; the flight of
the king had put an end to his authority and to the
respect of the people. It was a sad procession that
slowly made its way, in the evening light, along the
boulevards towards the Tuileries. When the king
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
and queen entered the palace the doors were closed
behind them, and armed guards stationed to prevent
egress. The palace had become a prison; Louis
XVI. had ceased to reign; the National Assembly
was now the governing power in France.</p>

<p>What followed a few words may tell. In the succeeding
year the Reign of Terror began, and Louis
was taken from the Tuileries to the Temple, a true
prison. In December he was tried for treason and
condemned to death, and on January 21, 1793, his
head fell under the knife of the guillotine. In
October of the same year his unhappy queen shared
his fate.

<a name="h2-29" id="h2-29"></a><h2><i>THE END OF THE TERROR.</i></h2>

<p>No period of equal length in the whole era of
history yields us such a succession of exciting and
startling events as those few years between the
convening of the States-General in France and the
rise of Napoleon to power, and particularly that
portion of the Revolution known as the Reign of
Terror. A volume of thrilling stories might have
been made from its incidents alone; but it would
have been a volume so full of tales of blood and woe,
of misery and massacre, of the dominance of those
wild-beast passions which civilization seeks to subdue
in man, that we may well be spared the telling.
As with the fall of the Bastille began the long
dominion of the populace, so with the fall of Robespierre
it ended, and civil order returned to unhappy
France. We have told the story of the one; we
shall conclude with that of the other.</p>

<p>Three men dominated the Terror,&mdash;Danton,
Marat, and Robespierre; the first named best deserving
the title of man, for he possessed certain
qualities of manliness not shown by his brutal
colleagues. As Lamartine says, "Nothing was
wanting to make Danton a great man except virtue."
He had too much manliness, as it seems, for
the purposes of Robespierre, and was brought by
him to the guillotine on April 5, 1794.</p>

<p>The triumvirate of the Reign of Terror was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
broken by his death and that of Marat, who had
fallen under the avenging knife of Charlotte Corday
in July, 1793. Robespierre was left sole director
of the Revolution, being president of the Committee
of Public Safety, leader of the Jacobin Club,
favorite of the extreme terrorists, and lord and
master of the Convention, whose members were held
in subjection by his violence and their fears.</p>

<p>His dominion was not to be of long continuance.
It was signalized by such a frightful activity of the
guillotine, in which multitudes of innocent persons
daily perished, that the terror which he produced
was quickly followed by indignation, and a combination
of many of the leading spirits of the Convention
was formed against him. One after another
he had vanquished all his enemies, and stood alone.
But he stood on such a ghastly pyramid of the dead
that he could not hope to maintain his dangerous
elevation. The voice of vengeance, long choked
by terror, at length began to rise against this wholesale
executioner.</p>

<p>The outbreak was precipitated by a demand of
Saint-Just, the most prominent supporter of Robespierre,
that a dictatorship should be established in
France, and that the "virtuous and inflexible, as
well as incorruptible citizen," Robespierre, should
be made Dictator. It was a declaration of war.
Many of the members of the Convention knew that
it meant their death. Once give their terrible foe
the extreme power which this demand indicated, and
every known enemy of Robespierre in France would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
be doomed. Yet to oppose it was to oppose the
Jacobins and the revolutionary sections, the controlling
powers in Paris. The boldest members of
the Convention might well pause and tremble before
assailing their seemingly impregnable foe. But the
rule of Robespierre had been opposed in committee;
it had ceased to be a secret that he had enemies
in the Convention; as yet the sentiment against him
had spoken only in the dark, but the time was
rapidly approaching when an open struggle could
no longer be avoided.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p307" id="p307"></a>
<img src="images/p307.jpg" alt="THE LAST VICTIMS OF THE REIGN OF TERROR." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">THE LAST VICTIMS OF THE REIGN OF TERROR.</span></div>

<p>Robespierre himself began the battle. He said
to a deputation from Aisne, "In the situation in
which it now is, gangrened by corruption, and without
power to remedy it, the Convention can no
longer save the republic; both will perish together."</p>

<p>He repeated this accusation before the Convention
itself, in a threatening speech, in which he declared
that there was in its midst a conspiracy against
public liberty; there were traitors in the national
councils; the Convention must be purged and purified;
the conspirators must be punished. His
words were listened to in sullen silence. When
he had ceased no word was spoken, except in whispers
from member to member. The glove of defiance
had been cast into their midst; were there
none among them with the courage to take it up,
or must they all yield themselves as the slaves or
the victims of this merciless autocrat? No; there
were men of courage and patriotism left. Three
delegates rose simultaneously, three voices struggled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
for precedence in the right to attack the tyrant
and dare the worst.</p>

<p>"The man who has made himself master of everything,
the man who paralyzes our will, is he who
has just spoken&mdash;Robespierre!" cried Cambon, in
ringing tones of defiance.</p>

<p>"It is Robespierre! It is Robespierre," came
from other unsealed voices. "Let him give an
account of the crimes of the members whose death
he demanded from the Jacobins."</p>

<p>The attack was so unexpected and so vehement
that Robespierre hesitated to reply</p>.

<p>"You who pretend to have the courage of virtue,
have the courage of truth," cried Charlier; "name
the individuals you accuse."</p>

<p>Tumult and confusion followed these daring
words. Robespierre, unable to gain the ear of the
assembly, which now seemed filled with his enemies,
and finding the feeling against him rapidly spreading,
left the hall and took refuge with the Jacobins,
where he repeated his address, this time to applauding
hearers. Violent councils followed. Henriot,
commandant of the troops, proposed to march on
the Convention and put an end to its existence.
"Name thy enemies," shouted the members to
Robespierre; "we will deliver them to thee." Yet
there was hesitation and doubt among the leaders;
they feared the result of violent measures, and felt
inclined to temporize and wait.</p>

<p>The Convention met the next day. It met inspired
with a new spirit. Courage animated the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
members. They had crossed the Rubicon, and felt
that there was no return. During the interval
since the last session their forces had been organized,
their plans considered. Saint-Just appeared
and sought to speak. He was interrupted and his
words drowned by the voices of indignant members.</p>

<p>"I see here," cried Billaud-Varennes, who stood
beside him, "one of the men who yesterday, at the
Jacobins, promised the massacre of the National
Convention; let him be arrested."</p>

<p>The officers obeyed this order. Saint-Just was
in custody. Billaud continued his remarks, declaring
that the members were in danger of massacre,
denouncing Robespierre and his supporters, bidding
them to be firm and resolute. His boldness infected
the assembly; the deputies stood up and
waved their hats, shouting their approval. In the
midst of this scene Robespierre appeared, livid with
rage, his eyes flashing with the fury which inspired
him.</p>

<p>"I demand liberty to speak," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Down with the tyrant!" rose in a roar from a
hundred voices.</p>

<p>Tallien, the leader of the opposition, sprang into
the tribune.</p>

<p>"I demand that the veil be torn away instantly,"
he exclaimed. "The work is done, the conspirators
are unmasked. Yesterday, at the Jacobins, I saw
the army of the new Cromwell formed, and I have
come here armed with a dagger to pierce his heart
if the Assembly dares not decree his accusation. I
demand the arrest of Henriot and his staff."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>The debate went on, growing more violent minute
by minute. Several times Robespierre strove to
speak, but each time his voice was drowned in cries
of "Down with the tyrant!" Pale with rage and
fear, he turned from his opponents towards his
former supporters, both hands nervously clutching
the tribune.</p>

<p>"It is to you, pure and virtuous men," he said,
"that I address myself. I do not talk with
scoundrels."</p>

<p>"Down with the tyrant!" was the response of
the members addressed. Evidently the whole assembly
had turned against him.</p>

<p>Henriot, the president, rang his bell for order.</p>

<p>"President of assassins," cried Robespierre, in a
voice that grew feebler, "I once more demand liberty
to speak."</p>

<p>"The blood of Danton is choking him!" cried
Garnier de l'Aude.</p>

<p>"Shall this man longer remain master of the
Convention?" asked Charles Duval.</p>

<p>"Let us make an end! A decree! a decree!"
shouted Lasseau.</p>

<p>"A tyrant is hard to strike down!" exclaimed
Fr&eacute;ron.</p>

<p>Robespierre stood in the midst of his circle of
enemies, assailed on all sides, nervously turning in
his hands an open knife.</p>

<p>"Send me to death!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"You have merited it a thousand times," cried
his foes. "Down with the tyrant!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of the tumult a decree for his arrest
was offered and carried. In it were included the
names of his brother, of Couthon, and of Saint-Just.
Henriot proclaimed the decree, while wild
acclamations of triumph shook the room.</p>

<p>"Long live liberty! Long live the republic!
Down with the tyrants! To the bar with the
accused!" came from the lips of those who the day
before had not dared to speak. The floodgates were
down and the torrent of long repressed fury was
rushing on the accused. The exciting scene ended
in the removal of the prisoners, who were taken to
separate prisons.</p>

<p>Tidings of what had taken place in the Convention
ran like wildfire through Paris. Thousands
of households were inspired with hope. The terrorists
were filled with fury and dismay. The Commune
and the Jacobins swore to support Robespierre.
The tocsin peal rang out; the people gathered;
the gates of Paris were closed; Henriot, half
drunk, galloped along the streets, crying out that
the representatives of the people were being massacred;
an insurrection against the Convention was
rapidly organized, headed by desperate men, among
them Robespierre himself, who was again free, having
been taken from the hands of the officers.</p>

<p>All was in peril. The Convention had assembled
again, but had taken no steps in self-defence. Startling
tidings were brought to the members in quick
succession. It was said that the National Guard
was coming with artillery, to direct it against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
hall. The roar of the insurrection filled street and
building. For the time it looked as if Robespierre
had conquered, and all was at an end.</p>

<p>"I propose," cried Elie Lacoste, "that Henriot
be outlawed."</p>

<p>As he spoke these words, the man named stood in
the street without, ordering the artillerists, whose
cannon were trained upon the Convention hall, to
fire. The gunners hesitated. It was a critical
moment. The fate of France hung in the balance.
A group of the deputies came hastily from the hall
and faced Henriot and his men.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, soldiers?" they exclaimed.
"That man is a rebel, who has just been outlawed."</p>

<p>The gunners lowered their matches. The Convention
was saved. The National Guard had deserted
Robespierre. Henriot put spurs to his horse,
and fled at full gallop.</p>

<p>"Outlaw all who shall take arms against the
Convention, or who shall oppose its decrees," said
Bar&egrave;re; "as well as those who have defied it by
eluding arrest."</p>

<p>This decree, repeated to the insurgents, completed
their discomfiture. Rapidly they dispersed.
Public opinion had changed; the Convention had
triumphed. The gunners who had marched with
the insurrection deserted their pieces; and a few
hours afterwards returned to them, to protect the
Convention.</p>

<p>The members of the Convention had run a serious
risk in not taking active steps to assemble their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
friends, and in thus giving so perilous an opportunity
to their enemies. This error was now retrieved;
a section of their supporters came together,
commanded by L&egrave;onard Bourdon and a gendarme
named M&eacute;da. They reached the H&ocirc;tel de Ville
without opposition. M&eacute;da entered it, crying, probably
as a strategem, "Long live Robespierre!"
He reached the hall where the Jacobin leaders were
gathered in silent dismay around the fallen dictator.
Robespierre sat at a table, his head resting on his
hand. M&eacute;da stepped towards him, pistols in hand.</p>

<p>"Surrender, traitor!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It is you who are a traitor," retorted Robespierre,
"and I will have you shot."</p>

<p>His words were barely spoken when M&eacute;da fired,
his bullet shattering Robespierre's lower jaw. It
is well to state here, however, that in the belief of
many Robespierre shot himself.</p>

<p>This decided action created consternation in the
room. The younger Robespierre leaped from a
window, receiving mortal injury from the fall.
Saint-Just turned towards Lebas and said to him,
"Kill me."</p>

<p>"I have something better to do," answered Lebas,
shooting himself through the head.</p>

<p>A report from the stairway quickly followed.
M&eacute;da with his second pistol had shot Couthon and
badly wounded him. The hall had suddenly become
a place of blood and death. The Jacobin chiefs,
lately all-powerful, now condemned, dead, or dying,
presented a frightful spectacle. Two days had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
changed the course of events in France. The Reign
of Terror was at an an end.</p>

<p>Robespierre lay on a table, his head supported by
a small deal box. The blood flowed slowly from
his mouth. He was silent, giving no sign of pain
or feeling. He was taken to the Conciergerie,
whither other prisoners of his faction were being
brought. Saint-Just and Couthon were already
there.</p>

<p>Five o'clock came. The carts had drawn up as
usual at the gate of the prison, waiting for the
condemned. This time there was a new spectacle
for the people, who had become wearied with
executions, but were on the alert for the fresh sensation
promised them. It was no time to temporize.
The Convention had ordered the immediate
execution of its foes. As Robespierre, with a blood-stained
cloth round his face, entered the cart, there
was a shout of joy and triumph from the assembled
crowd. The late all-powerful man had not a
friend left.</p>

<p>On the scaffold the executioner tore the cloth
from Robespierre's wounded face. A terrible cry of
pain followed, the first sign of suffering he had
given. In a minute more his head had fallen into
the gory basket, and France was avenged. It was
the 28th of July, 1794, less than four months after
the death of Danton had left all the power in his
hands. In that and the following days one hundred
and three executions sealed the fate of the
defeated enemies of the Convention. Justice had
been done; the Terror was at an end.

<a name="h2-30" id="h2-30"></a><h2><i>THE BURNING OF MOSCOW.</i></h2>

<p>From west to east across Europe had marched
the army of the great conqueror, no nation daring
to draw a hostile sword, none venturing to place
an obstacle in its path. Across Russia it had
marched almost as triumphantly, breaking irresistibly
through the dams of armed men in its way,
sweeping onward with the strength and majesty of
fate. At length it had reached the heart of the
empire of the czars, and before it lay displayed the
ancient capital of the Muscovite kings, time-honored
Moscow.</p>

<p>This great city was revealed to the eyes of the
weary soldiers with the suddenness of a mirage in
the desert. Throughout that day an interminable
outreach of level country had seemed to spread before
them, dreary, uninviting, disheartening. Now,
from the summit of a hill, their triumphant eyes
gazed suddenly upon the roofs and spires of a mighty
city, splendid, far-reaching, stretching far across
the plain that lay revealed before their eyes. It
seemed to them truly as if the hand of a magician
had touched the desert, and caused this city to spring
up across their path.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable spectacle that met their gaze.
Here were visible what seemed hundreds of gilded
domes and shining spires, thousands of habitations
rich with varied colors, a strange compound of palaces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and cottages, churches and bell-towers, woods
and lakes, Western and Oriental architecture, the
Gothic arches and spires of Europe mingled with the
strange forms of Byzantine and Asiatic edifices.
Outwardly, a line of monasteries flanked with
towers appeared to encircle the city. Centrally,
crowning an eminence, rose a great citadel, from
whose towers one could look down on columned
temples and imperial palaces, embattled walls
crowned with majestic domes, from whose summits,
above the reversed crescent, rose the cross, Russia's
emblem of conquest over the fanatical sectaries
of the East. It was the Kremlin which they here
beheld, the sacred centre of the Russian empire,
the ancient dwelling-place and citadel of the czars.</p>

<p>A wild cry of wonder and triumph burst from the
soldiers who had first reached the summit of the
hill. "Moscow! Moscow!" they shouted, their
imaginations strongly excited by the magnificent
spectacle. This cry lent wings to those behind
them. In crowding hosts the eager soldiers rushed
up the long slope, all ranks mingling in their burning
desire to gaze upon that great city which was the
goal of their far-extended march. Deep were the
emotions, intense the joy, with which they gazed
on this dazzling vision, with all its domes and spires
burning in the warm rays of the sun. Napoleon
himself, who hastened to the spot, was struck with
admiration, and new dreams of glory doubtless
sprang up in his soul as he stood gazing with deep
emotion on what must have seemed to him the key
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
of the East, the gateway to conquests never yet
surpassed by man. Little did he dream that it was
ruin upon which he gazed, the fatal turning-point
in his long career of victory. Still certain of his
genius, still confident in his good fortune, he looked
forward to new conquests which would throw those
of the past into the shade, and as his eyes rested
on that mighty city of the czars, the intoxication
of glory filled his soul.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a name="p317" id="p317"></a>
<img src="images/p317.jpg" alt="THE CITY OF MOSCOW." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">THE CITY OF MOSCOW.</span></div>

<p>The conqueror gave but little time to these
dreams. The steps to realize them must be taken.
Murat was bidden to march forward quickly and to
repress all disorders which might break out in the
city. Denni&eacute;e was ordered to hasten and arrange
for the food and lodging of the soldiers. Durosnel
received orders to communicate with the authorities,
to calm their fears, and to lead them to the conqueror,
that he might receive their homage. Fancying
that the inhabitants awaited his coming in
trembling fear, Napoleon halted until these preliminaries
should be arranged, before making his
triumphant entry into the conquered capital of
Muscovy.</p>

<p>Murat, at the head of the light cavalry, galloped
rapidly forward, quickly reaching the bridge over
the Moskowa. Here he found a rear-guard of the
Russian army, in rapid retreat. The meeting was
not a hostile one; Murat rode to the Russian line,
and asked if there was an officer among them who
spoke French. A young Russian immediately presented
himself, and asked him what he wanted.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is the commander of this rear-guard?"
he asked.</p>

<p>The Russian pointed to a white-haired officer,
who wore a long cloak of fur. Murat advanced
and held out his hand. The officer took and pressed
it warmly.</p>

<p>"Do you know me?" asked the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Russian, courteously; "we
have seen enough of you under fire to know you."</p>

<p>A short colloquy succeeded, during which Murat
could not keep his eyes from the officer's fur cloak,
which looked as if it would be very comfortable in a
winter bivouac. The Russian, noticing his looks,
took off the mantle and offered it to him, begging
him to accept it as a present from an admiring foe.
Murat courteously accepted it, and in return presented
the officer with a beautiful and valuable
watch, which was accepted in the same spirit of
courteous good-will.</p>

<p>The Russian officer now joined his men, who were
filing rapidly away, and Murat rode onward into
the streets of the captured city, his staff and a
detachment of cavalry accompanying him. Through
street after street he passed, here finding himself
moving between rows of narrow wooden houses,
there through avenues bordered by palatial residences,
which rose from rich and ample gardens,
but all silent and seemingly deserted.</p>

<p>The city was there, but where were the people?
Solitude surrounded him. Not an inhabitant was
to be seen. It seemed a city of the dead. Into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Berlin, Vienna, and other capitals had the French
army entered, but never had it seen anything like
this utter solitude. The inhabitants, so the surprised
soldiers fancied, must be cowering in terror
within their houses. This desolation could not continue.
Moscow was known as one of the most
bustling cities in Europe. As soon as the people
learned that no harm was meant them, the streets
would again swarm with busy life. Hugging this
flattering opinion to his soul, Murat rode on,
threading the silent city.</p>

<p>Ah! here were some of the people. A few distracted
individuals had appeared in the streets.
Murat rode up to them, to find that they were
French, belonging to the foreign colony of Moscow.
They begged piteously for protection from the robbers,
who, they said, had become masters of the
town. They told Murat more than this, destroying
the pleasant picture of a submissive and contented
population with which he had solaced his mind.
The population had fled, they said; no one was left
in the city except a few strangers and some Russians
who knew the ways of the French and did
not fear them. In their place was a crew of thieves
and bandits whom the Count of Rostopchin had let
loose on deserted Moscow, emptying the prisons and
setting these convicts free to ravage the city at
their will.</p>

<p>Further evidence of this disheartening story was
soon forthcoming. When the French approached
the Kremlin they were saluted by a discharge of
musketry. Some of the villanous crew had invaded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the capitol, seized on the guns in the arsenal, and
were firing on the invaders. A few minutes settled
this last effort in the defence of Moscow. The
citadel was entered at a charge, several of the villanous
crew were sabred, and the others put to flight.
The French had the town, but it was an empty
one, its only inmates being thieves and strangers.</p>

<p>The next morning, September 15, 1812, Napoleon
made his triumphal march into Moscow, at the head
of his conquering legions. But for the first time in
his career of victory he found himself in the streets
of a deserted city, advancing through empty avenues,
to whose windows the tread of marching feet
called not an eye to witness the triumph of France.
It was a gloomy and threatening impression which
was experienced by the grand army in its progress
through those silent and lifeless streets. The
ancient city of the czars seemed a body without a
soul.</p>

<p>But if the people were gone, their dwellings
remained. Moscow was taken, with all its palaces
and treasures. It was a signal conquest. Napoleon
hastened to the Kremlin, mounted to the top of the
lofty tower of Ivan, and from its height looked
with eyes of pride on the far-extending city. It
was grand, that vision of palatial mansions, but it
was mournful in its silence and gloom, the tramp of
soldiery its only sound, the flutter of multitudes of
birds&mdash;ravens and crows, which haunted the city in
thousands&mdash;its only sign of life. Two days before
Moscow had been one of the busiest cities in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
world. Now it was the most silent. But the conqueror
had this satisfaction, that while abandoned
like other Russian towns, it was not burned like
them, he might find here winter-quarters for his
army and by mild measures lure the frightened
people back to their homes again. Comforted with
this hopeful view, Napoleon descended the stairs
again, filled with confidence and triumph.</p>

<p>His confidence was misplaced. Disaster lowered
upon the devoted city. On the day succeeding his
entrance a column of flame suddenly appeared,
rising from a large building in which was stored
an abundant supply of spirits. The soldiers ran
thither without thought of alarm, fancying that this
was due to some imprudence on the part of their
own men. In a short time the fire was mastered,
and a feeling of confidence returned.</p>

<p>But immediately afterwards a new fire broke out
in a great collection of buildings called the Bazaar,
in which were the richest shops of the city, filled
with costly goods, the beautiful fabrics of Persia
and India, and rare and precious commodities from
all quarters of the world. Here the flames spread
with extraordinary rapidity, consuming the inflammable
goods with frightful haste, despite the frantic
efforts of the soldiers to arrest their progress. Despairing
of success, they strove to save something
from the vast riches of the establishment, carrying
out furs, costly wines, valuable tissues, and other
precious treasures. Such as remained of the people
of the town aided in these efforts, in the natural
desire to save something from the flames.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Until now all this seemed ordinary accident, and
no one dreamed that these fires were the result of
hostile design. They were soon to learn more of
the unconquerable determination of the Russians.
During the following night the wind rose suddenly,
and carried the flames of the burning Bazaar
along several of the most beautiful streets of Moscow,
the fire spreading rapidly among the wooden
buildings, and consuming them with alarming
rapidity.</p>

<p>But this was not the most disturbing indication.
Rockets were seen in the distance, ascending into
the air, and immediately afterwards fire broke out
in a dozen quarters, and hired bandits were seen
carrying combustibles at the end of long poles, and
seeking to extend the empire of the flames. A number
of these were arrested, and under threat of
death revealed a frightful secret. The Count of
Rostopchin had ordered that the great city of Moscow
should be set on fire and burned, with as little
heed for the immense loss involved as he would
have had in ordering the burning of a wayside
village.</p>

<p>The news filled the whole army with consternation.
Waiting till the wind had risen, the
ferocious count had sent up his signal-rockets to
order the work to begin. He had done more. On
running to the pumps to obtain water to extinguish
the flames, there were none to be found. They had
been removed and the fire-extinguishing apparatus
destroyed in preparation for this incendiary work.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon, alarmed and incensed, ordered that all
caught in the act of firing buildings should be
executed on the spot. The army was directed to use
every effort to extinguish the flames. But the high
wind set all their efforts at defiance. It increased
in fury and varied in direction, carrying the conflagration
over new quarters. From the Kremlin
could be seen vast columns of fire, shooting from
building to building, wrapping the wooden structures
in lurid sheets of flame, sweeping destruction
forward at frightful speed. The roar of the flames,
the explosions that from time to time took place,
the burning fragments which filled the air, borne
on the wings of the wind, all went to make a scene
as grand and fearful as human eye has ever gazed
upon. To Napoleon and his men, who saw their
hopes of safe and pleasant winter-quarters thus
vanishing in flame, it must have been a most alarming
and disquieting spectacle.</p>

<p>After blowing for some hours from the north-west,
the wind shifted to the south-west, and the
conflagration invaded new regions of the city. The
Kremlin, hitherto out of the range of the flames,
was now in danger. Fiery sparks, borne by the
wind, fell on its roof and in its court-yard. The
most frightful danger of the whole night now threatened
the imperilled army. In the court-yards of
the Kremlin had been placed more than four hundred
wagons of ammunition; in its arsenal were a
hundred thousand pounds of powder. Should the
flames reach these, Napoleon and his guards would

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>All who were near him pressed him to hasten
from this imminent peril. General Lariboisi&egrave;re
begged him to fly, as a duty which he owed to his
army. Officers who came in from the streets reported
that it was almost impossible to pass through
the avenues of the town, and that delay would increase
the danger. To remain where they were
much longer might render escape impossible.</p>

<p>Napoleon, convinced by these words, left the
Kremlin, after some twenty-four hours' possession
of this old palace of the czars, and descended to the
quay of the Moskowa, where he found his horses
awaiting him. Mounting, he rode through the fire-invaded
streets towards the north-west, but with no
little difficulty and danger, for the flames from the
other quarters of the city were now spreading here.</p>

<p>The wind seemed steadily to increase in violence,
torrents of smoke, cinders, and sparks were driven
down into the streets; sheets of flame seemed to
bend downward as if to sweep the ground; on
every side the troops were flying for their lives,
on every side the conflagration pursued them; it
was through imminent peril that the grand army,
which on the morning before had marched so
triumphantly into that abandoned city, now succeeded
in gaining a safe location outside, whence
they could look back in despair on that hell of
flames in which their dearest hopes were being
consumed.</p>

<p>A small number of the inhabitants who had
remained concealed in their houses now came out,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
carrying away with them what treasures they most
esteemed; in some cases, women their children,
men their aged parents; many of them barely saving
their clothes, and disputing the possession of
even these with the band of robbers whom Rostopchin
had let loose, and who, like spirits of evil,
danced with glee in the midst of the terrible conflagration
which had been kindled by their hands.</p>

<p>So ended one of the most startling events in history,&mdash;the
burning of a great city to dispossess a
victorious foe. It proved successful. When Napoleon
left the Kremlin on that fearful night he began
his downward career. The conflagration, it is true,
did not drive him at once from Moscow. He lingered
for more than a month amid its ruins, in the
vain hope that the czar would ask him for terms of
peace. But the czar kept silent, the city was untenable
for winter-quarters, and retreat became
imperative. When, at length, the grand army
marched, winter marched with it,&mdash;a winter such
as even Russia had rarely seen. Napoleon had
delayed too long. The north gathered its forces
and swooped upon his shivering ranks, with death
in its blasts. The Russians, recovering from their
losses, rushed upon his freezing columns, pouring
destruction upon them as they marched. All was
at an end. The great victor's tide of success had
definitely turned. He had entered Russia with
nearly half a million of men; hardly a tenth part
of this great army followed him from that fatal
land.

<a name="h2-31" id="h2-31"></a><h2><i>NAPOLEON'S RETURN
FROM ELBA.</i></h2>

<p>All was quiet in Elba. Nothing was talked of
at Porto-Ferrajo but the ball to be given by Pauline,
the sister of Napoleon, who had exchanged his imperial
dominion over half Europe for kingship over
that little Mediterranean island. Evening came.
The f&ecirc;te was a brilliant one. Napoleon was present,
gay, cheerful, easy, to all appearance fully satisfied
with his little kingdom, and without thought of
wider empire or heavier cares. He stayed till a late
hour, and went home with two of his old generals,
Bertrand and Drouet, to tell them the news which
had come to him from the continent. This news
was not altogether to his liking. The Congress at
Vienna had decreed his transportation to the Azores.
Elba was too near France.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs on the night of
February 25, 1815. At sunset of the next day there
might have been seen a small flotilla moving before
a south wind along the shores of Elba. It consisted
of a brig, the Inconstant by name, a schooner, and
five smaller vessels. The brig evidently carried guns.
The decks of the other vessels were crowded with
men in uniform. On the deck of the Inconstant
stood Napoleon, his face filled with hope and joy,
his hand waving an adieu to his sister Pauline, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
watched him from the ch&acirc;teau windows, on the
island shore.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p327" id="p327"></a>
<img src="images/p327.jpg" alt="ARC DE TRIOMPHE AND CHAMPS ELYSEES. PARIS." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">ARC DE TRIOMPHE AND CHAMPS ELYSEES. PARIS.</span></div>

<p>The next day came. The sea was motionless.
Not a breath of wind could be felt. The island was
still close at hand. At a distance might be seen the
French and English cruisers which guarded that
side of the island, now moveless upon a moveless
sea. It was doubtful if the flotilla had not better
return. But the wind rose again, and their progress
was resumed.</p>

<p>Four in the afternoon found them off the heights
of Leghorn. Five leagues to leeward lay one
frigate; near the shores of Corsica was another;
to windward could be seen a third, making its
way towards the flotilla. It was the Zephyr, of
the French navy, commanded by Captain Andrieux.
Now had come a vital moment in the enterprise.
Should the Emperor declare himself and seek to
gain over Andrieux? It was too dangerous a venture;
he bade the grenadiers on the deck to conceal
themselves; it was a situation in which strategy
seemed better than boldness. At six the two vessels
were close together. Lieutenant Taillade of the Inconstant
knew and saluted Captain Andrieux. A
speaking-trumpet colloquy followed.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound?" asked Taillade.</p>

<p>"To Leghorn. And you?"</p>

<p>"To Genoa. Have you any commissions I can
execute there?</p>"

<p>"Thanks, not any. How is the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Very well."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>"So much the better."</p>

<p>The two vessels moved on, and soon lost sight of
each other in the growing darkness. The other
frigates had disappeared.</p>

<p>The next day dawned. There was visible a large
frigate in the distance, but it was not moving
towards the flotilla. No danger was to be feared
from this source. But the vessel's head had been
turned to the southward, to Taillade's surprise.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he called to the officers on the
bridge, "are we bound for Spain or for Africa?"</p>

<p>Napoleon, who had perceived the same thing,
summoned Taillade from his conference with the
officers.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sire, we are headed for Africa."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to go there. Take me to France."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty shall be there before noon tomorrow."</p>

<p>The face of Napoleon beamed on hearing these
words. He turned to the soldiers of the Old Guard
who accompanied him, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, grenadiers, we are going to France, to
Paris." Enthusiastic "<i>vivas</i>" followed his announcement,
which told a tale of future glory to
those war-hardened veterans. They had fought for
the Emperor on many a mighty field. They were
ready to dare new dangers in the hope of new
triumphs.</p>

<p>On the morning of Wednesday, March 1, the
shores of France were visible from the vessel's deck.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
At three in the afternoon anchor was dropped in the
Bay of Juan. Cheers and salvos of artillery greeted
those welcome shores; the boats were quickly
dropped, and by five o'clock the whole expedition
was on shore. The soldiers made their bivouac in
an olive grove on the borders of the bay.
</p>
<p>"Happy omen!" said Napoleon; "the olive is
the emblem of peace."</p>

<p>He plucked some violets, and then sat down and
consulted his maps, which were spread on a table
before him. There were two routes which might be
taken; an easy one through Provence, and a difficult
one over the snowy mountains of Dauphiny.
But on the former he could not count on the loyalty
of the people; on the latter he could: the difficult
route was chosen.</p>

<p>It proved a cold and wearying journey. The men
were obliged to march in single file along narrow
roads which bordered precipices. Several mules,
one of them laden with gold, lost their footing and
were plunged down the cliff. Napoleon was forced
to dismount and go on foot to keep warm. For a
short time he rested beside the brush-wood fire of a
cabin whose only tenant was an old woman.</p>

<p>"Have you any news from Paris?" he asked
her. "Do you know what the king is doing?"</p>

<p>"The king? You mean the Emperor," answered
the old woman. "He is always down yonder."</p>

<p>So, here was a Frenchwoman who had not heard
a word of the last year's doings. Was this the stuff
of glory? Napoleon looked at General Drouet, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
said, in pensive tones, "Do you hear this, Drouet?
What, after all, is the good of troubling the world
in order to fill it with our name?"</p>

<p>We cannot follow their progress step by step.
That small army of a thousand men was marching
to conquer a kingdom, but for days it had only the
mountains and the snows to overcome. As yet not
a soldier had been encountered, and they had been
a week on shore. But the news of the landing had
now spread far and wide, and soldiers were marching
to stop the advance of the "Brigand of Elba,"
as the royalists in Paris called Napoleon. How
would they receive him,&mdash;with volleys or acclamations?
That was soon to be learned. The troops
in that part of France were concentrated at Grenoble
and its vicinity. The Emperor was approaching
them. The problem would soon be solved.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock of March 7 Napoleon separated
his small force into three divisions, himself taking
station in the midst of the advance-guard, on horseback,
wearing his famous gray overcoat and the
broad ribbon of the Legion of Honor. About one
o'clock the small battalion approached a regiment of
the troops of the king, who were drawn up in line
across the road. Napoleon dismounted.</p>

<p>"Colonel Mallet," he said, "tell the soldiers to
put their weapons under their left arms, points
down."</p>

<p>"Sire," said the colonel, "is it not dangerous to
act thus in presence of troops whose sentiments
we do not know, and whose first fire may be so
fatal?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mallet, tell them to put the weapons under
their arms," repeated Napoleon.</p>

<p>The order was obeyed. The two battalions faced
each other, at short pistol-shot, in absolute silence.
Napoleon advanced alone towards the royal troops.</p>

<p>"Present arms!" he commanded.</p>

<p>They obeyed, levelling their guns at their old
commander. He advanced slowly, with impassive
face. Reaching their front, he touched his cap and
saluted.</p>

<p>"Soldiers of the Fifth," he cried, loudly, "do
you recognize me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," came from some voices, filled with
barely-repressed enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Soldiers, behold your general; behold your emperor,"
he continued. "Let any of you who wishes
to kill him, fire."</p>

<p>Fire?&mdash;Their guns went to the earth; they flung
themselves on their knees before him, called him
father, shed tears, shouted as if in frenzy, waved
their shakos on their bayonets and sabres.</p>

<p>"All is over," said Napoleon to Bertrand and
Drouet. "In ten days we shall be in the Tuileries."</p>

<p>In a brief time the Emperor moved on, the king's
regiment, now wearing the tricolor cockade, following
with his former troop. As they drew near
Grenoble throngs of peasantry gathered, with enthusiastic
cheers. Another regiment approached,
the seventh of the line, commanded by Colonel de
Lab&eacute;doy&egrave;re. He had taken the eagle of the regiment
from a chest, brandished his sword, and crying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
"Long live the Emperor! Those who love me
follow me!" led the way from Grenoble. The
whole regiment followed. Meeting Napoleon, the
colonel and the Emperor sprang from their horses
and warmly embraced.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p332" id="p332"></a>
<img src="images/p332.jpg" alt="NAPOLEON&#39;S RETURN FROM ELBA." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">NAPOLEON&#39;S RETURN FROM ELBA.</span></div>

<p>"Colonel," said Napoleon, "it is you who will
replace me on the throne."</p>

<p>It was night when they reached Grenoble. The
royalist authorities had closed the gates, but the
ramparts were thronged with men. The darkness
was profound, but Lab&eacute;doy&egrave;re called out loudly,&mdash;
</p>
<p>"Soldiers, it is I, Lab&eacute;doy&egrave;re, colonel of the Seventh.
We bring you Napoleon. He is yonder.
It is for you to receive him and to repeat with us
the rallying-cry of the former conquerors of Europe:
Live the Emperor!"</p>

<p>His words were followed by a ringing shout from
the ramparts. Many ran to the gates. Finding
them closed and barred they furiously attacked them
with axes, while the peasants outside hammered on
them as fiercely. Thus doubly assailed they soon
gave way, and the stream of new-comers rushed
in, torches and flambeaux illuminating the scene.
Napoleon had no little difficulty in making his way
through the crowd, which was delirious with joy,
and reaching an inn, the Three Dauphins, where he
designed to pass the night.</p>

<p>On the 9th he left Grenoble, followed by six
thousand of his old soldiers. His march was an
ovation. He reached Lyons on the 10th. Several
regiments had been collected here to oppose him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
but they all trampled the white cockade of the king
underfoot, assumed the tricolor, and fraternized
with the Emperor's troops.</p>

<p>Marshal Ney was the only hope left to the royalists.
He had, they said, promised Louis XVIII. to
bring back Napoleon in an iron cage. This hope
vanished when Ney issued a proclamation beginning,
"The cause of the Bourbons is lost forever;"
which was followed, on March 18, by his embracing
the Emperor openly at Auxerre.</p>

<p>All was over for Louis XVIII. Near midnight
of March 19 some travelling carriages rolled away
from the court-yard of the Touileries in a torrent of
rain, and amid a furious wind-storm that extinguished
the carriage lights. It was Louis XVIII.
going into exile. On the 20th, at nine o'clock in
the evening, the Emperor Napoleon drove through
the streets of Paris towards the abandoned palace
through hosts of shouting soldiers and a population
that was wild with joy. The officers tore him from
his carriage and carried him on their arms, kissing
his hands, embracing his old gray overcoat, not letting
his feet touch ground till they had borne him
to the foot of the grand stairway of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>It was twenty days since he had landed, and
France was his, the people, the soldiers, alike mad
with delight, none, to all appearance, dreaming of
what renewed miseries this ill-omened return of
their worshipped emperor meant.</p>

<p>It meant, as we now know, bloodshed, slaughter,
and ruin; it meant Waterloo and St. Helena; it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
meant a hundred days of renewed empire, and then
the final end of the power of the great conqueror.
On August 7, less than five months from the date
of the triumphant entry to the Tuileries, Napoleon
stepped on board the British frigate Northumberland,
to be borne to the far-off isle of St. Helena,
his future home.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years after the date of these events
Napoleon returned again to France, but under very
different auspices from those described. On the
29th of November, 1840, there anchored at Cherbourg,
amid the salutes of forts and ships, a French
war-vessel called the Belle Poule, on which were the
mortal remains of the great conqueror, long since
conquered by death, and now brought back to the
land over which he had so long reigned. On December
8 the coffin was transferred to the steamer
Normandie, amid a salute of two thousand guns,
and taken by it to the Seine. On December 15 the
coffin, placed on a splendid car drawn by sixteen
horses, moved in solemn procession through the
streets of Paris, attended by the noblest escort the
city could provide, and passing through avenues
thronged with adoring multitudes, who forgot the
injuries the great soldier had done to France and
remembered only his fame. The funeral train was
received by King Louis Philippe, the royal family,
and all the high dignitaries of the government at
the Church of the Invalides, in which a noble and
worthy final resting-place had been prepared for the
corpse of the once mighty emperor. "Napoleon,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
says Bourrienne, "had again and finally conquered.
While every throne in Europe was shaking, the
Great Conqueror came to claim and receive from
posterity the crown for which he had sacrificed so
much. In the Invalides the Emperor had at last
found a resting-place, 'by the banks of the Seine,
among the French people whom he had loved so
well.'"

<br /><br /><br /></p>

<a name="h2-32" id="h2-32"></a><h2><i>THE PRUSSIAN WAR AND
THE PARIS COMMUNE</i>.</h2>

<p>There have been two critical periods in the
story of France in which history was made at a
rate of rapidity rarely equalled in the history of
the world. The first of these was the era of the
Revolution and the Napoleonic r&eacute;gime, which has
no parallel among human events in the rapidity and
momentous gravity of its changes. The second was
the period from August, 1870, to the summer of
1871, less than a year in length, yet crowded with
important events to an unprecedented degree.</p>

<p>Within that year was fought a great war between
France and Germany, in which the military power
of France, in an incredibly brief period, was utterly
overthrown, and that nation left at the mercy of
its opponent. Within the same period the second
empire of France came to a sudden and disastrous
end, and a republic, the third in French history,
was built upon its ruins. Simultaneously a new
and powerful empire was founded, that of Germany,
the palace at Versailles being the scene of this highly
important change in the political conditions of
Europe. During this period also a political revolution
took place in Italy, in consequence of the
French war, and Paris sustained two sieges; the first
by the German army; the second and most bitter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
by the French themselves, fighting against a mob of
fanatical revolutionists and ending in a frightful
saturnalia of murder, ruin and revenge.</p>

<p>Has there ever been a year in the world's history
more crowded with momentous events? Within
that year the political status of France, Germany,
and Italy was transformed, the late emperor of
France suddenly found himself a throneless fugitive,
and the people of Paris passed through an experience
unparalleled in the diversified history of that
ancient city. Of all the sieges to which Paris has
been subjected, far the strangest was that in which
the scum of the city, miscalled the commune, fought
with tiger-like ferocity against the forces of the
newly-formed republic, filled with the revengeful
and murderous spirit which had inspired the masses
in the first revolution.</p>

<p>It is the story of this tragic interlude which we
propose here to tell, premising with a brief r&eacute;sum&eacute;
of the events which led up to it.</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon, posing as Emperor Napoleon
III. of France, a position which he had been enabled
to gain through the glamour of the name of his
famous uncle, was infected throughout his reign
with the desire to emulate the deeds of the great
Napoleon. He hoped to shine as one of the military
stars of Europe, and was encouraged by the success
of the war which he fomented in Italy. His second
effort in this direction was the invasion of Mexico
and the attempt to establish an empire, under
his tutelage, upon American soil. In this he ran
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
counter to the Monroe Doctrine and the power of
the United States and was forced to retire with his
feathers scorched and his prestige sadly diminished.</p>

<p>But what he probably proposed to make the
great military triumph of his reign came in 1870,
when, on a flimsy pretence, a misunderstanding
which called only for diplomatic adjustment, he
suddenly declared war against Germany and rashly
put his armies into the field to cope with that
powerful rival. Never had there been a more
unwise or suicidal proceeding. In shameful ignorance
of the real condition of the army, which he
was made to believe was "five times ready," "ready
to the last gaiter button," he marshalled against the
thoroughly prepared military power of Germany
an army ill-organized, ill-supplied, without proper
reserves, and led by commanders of appalling incapacity.
Maps and plans were bad; strategy was
an unknown quantity; no study had been made of
the use of the railway in war; almost everything
except courage was lacking, and courage without
leadership was hopeless against the thoroughly
drilled and supplied German army and the science
of Yon Moltke, the great German strategist.</p>

<p>Had it been the first Napoleon, he would have
made himself sure personally as to "the last gaiter
button" and all other details, but with sublime
self-satisfaction and inane blindness the Second
Napoleon put himself at the head of this unready
army, inspired apparently with the "on to Berlin"
confidence of the cheering Parisian mob.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>He was to be awakened suddenly and painfully
from his dream of victory and military fame. The
first collision of the two armies took place on August
2. On September 2, just one month later, the
derelict emperor was a prisoner of war in the hands
of the King of Prussia, together with his army of
more than 80,000 men. He had proved an utter
failure as a commander, a mere encumbrance, without
a plan of campaign, a conception of leadership,
or an idea of strategic movements. Recognizing,
when too late, his incapacity, he had resigned the
general command to Marshal Bazaine, who withdrew
with a large army into Metz, and subsequently, in a
northward movement for Bazaine's relief, he found
himself surrounded at Sedan by an irresistible force
and was obliged to surrender to save his army from
impending annihilation.</p>

<p>Such was the first act in this lugubrious drama.
Two days later, on September 4, France was proclaimed
a republic. Before the end of October
Bazaine surrendered Metz to the Germans and
his great army of 180,000 men was lost to France.
The military force of France was vanishing with
alarming rapidity. Another event of the period, of
interest in this connection, was the loss of the temporal
power of the pope, above alluded to. The
papacy had been defended by Napoleon III. against
the Italian revolutionists, and the withdrawal of
the French force from Rome left that city open to
the army of Victor Emmanuel. It was occupied in
September and became the capital of the new kingdom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
of Italy. In December another important
event took place, the King of Prussia being proclaimed
at Versailles the head of a new empire of
Germany, which embraced all the German states
except Austria.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p340" id="p340"></a>
<img src="images/p340.jpg" alt="SCENE FROM THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">SCENE FROM THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.</span></div>

<p>Events of great moment, as may be seen, were
occurring with startling rapidity. Before the surrender
of Bazaine the advance of the German army
had appeared before Paris and on September 19
the siege of that city began. Soon it was so closely
invested that food could not enter and the only
way out was by balloon. The German bombardment
did little damage to the great city, which was
defended obstinately. But the Germans had a powerful
ally within, where the grisly demon of famine
threatened the defenders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gambetta, the most ardent patriot left
to France, was seeking with nervous energy to raise
fresh armies in the south; Garibaldi, his sword free
from duty in Italy, had come to the aid of France;
all patriots were called to the ranks and a struggle
of some importance took place. But all this practically
ceased on the 28th of January, 1871, when an
armistice brought the hopeless resistance of Paris to
an end. Almost at once the war died out on all
sides, the Germans occupied all the forts around
Paris, and France lay at the mercy of Germany,
after a struggle of six months' duration.</p>

<p>The first siege of Paris had terminated; a second
and more desperately contested one was at hand.
On March 13 the German army around Paris, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
had been given the triumph of a march into the
conquered city, set out on its return home and the
authorities of the new republic prepared to take
possession of their freed capital.</p>

<p>They were to find the task one of unlooked-for
difficulty. On March 18 the revolutionary element
of the city rose <i>en masse</i>, organized under the name
of the Commune, took possession of Paris, and prepared
to defend it to the death against the leaders
of the new-formed government, whom they contemned
as aristocrats.</p>

<p>The story of the Commune is a shameful and
terrible one. Beginning in a fraternization of the
National Guard with the mob, its advent was sealed
with murder. In a contest on the 18th for the
possession of some cannon General Lecomte ordered
his men to fire on the insurgents. They refused.
A gentleman standing in a crowd of angry men on
the street corner said: "General Lecomte is right."
He was immediately seized and quickly recognised
as General Cl&eacute;ment Thomas, a brave officer who
had done gallant service during the siege. This
sufficed him nothing with the mob. He and General
Lecomte were at once dragged away to prison.
At 4 o'clock that same day they were brought out
by a party of the insurgent National Guards, and
after a mock trial were taken to a walled enclosure
and shot down in cold blood. They were the first
victims of the mob, which had early begun to burn
its bridges behind it.</p>

<p>On the following day the leaders of the outbreak
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
met at the H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville. They all belonged to the
International, a secret society formed for the abolition
of property, religion, rulers, government, and
the upper classes, and the reduction of the community
to a state of anarchy or something resembling
it. They called upon the citizens to meet
in their sections and elect a commune&mdash;the new
form of government advocated by the Anarchists,
in which destruction of all existing institutions was
to precede reconstruction from the bottom upwards.</p>

<p>Events now moved rapidly. A delegation from
the few men of note left in Paris proceeded to
Versailles, where the government of the republic
was in session, and demanded that special municipal
rights should be given to the people of Paris. The
refusal of this request precipitated the insurrection.
The furious people at once elected a revolutionary
government, choosing the most extreme of the revolutionists,
who organized what was called the
Council of the Commune. This consisted of eighty
members, of varied nationality, seventy of them
never having been heard of in Paris before. They
had risen from the bottom of the deep sea of
anarchy to assume control.</p>

<p>On the 3d of April the civil war broke out&mdash;Paris
against Versailles, the army under the Assembly
of the republic against the National Guard
in sympathy with the Commune. The Germans,
who still held two of the forts in the vicinity of
Paris, looked grimly on at the tragedy about to be
played upon the stage which their hands had
erected.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>The war began with murder. Dr. Pasquier, a
distinguished surgeon, bearing a flag of truce, met
two National Guards on the bridge of Courbevoie,
near Neuilly, where the body of Napoleon had been
brought ashore thirty years before. After a brief
debate one of the soldiers ended the colloquy by
blowing out the doctor's brains. As soon as General
Vinoy, in command of the army of order, heard
of this murderous act he ordered the guns of Fort
Var&eacute;lien to be turned upon the city.</p>

<p>On the following morning five columns of the
troops of the Commune marched out to take the
fort, lured by the confident impression that the soldiers
under Vinoy would fraternize with them.
They were mistaken. The guns of Fort Var&eacute;lien
hurled death-dealing missiles into their columns and
they were quickly in full retreat. Flourens, a
scientist of fame who had joined their ranks, fell
dead. Duval, one of their generals, was captured
and was quickly shot as a traitor. The other
leaders were at once sent to prison by the angry
Council on their return and the Commune ordered
that Paris should be filled with barricades.</p>

<p>Though the Commune had imprisoned the unsuccessful
generals, they were infuriated at the
execution of General Duval and sought in the
dignitaries of the church the most exalted hostages
they could find against such summary acts. On
the night of the 6th Monseigneur Darboy, Archbishop
of Paris, his chaplain, and eight other priests
were arrested. The cur&eacute; of the Madeleine and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
vicar had before been seized. Other priests were
later taken into custody and the prison at Mazas
was well filled with these so-called hostages. The
fury of the leaders of the revolt led them to other
excesses against religion, the churches being closed,
the arms cut from the crosses, and red flags hung in
their stead.</p>

<p>The outrages were not confined to the church.
In the words of a resident of Paris: "The motto
of the Commune soon became fraternity of that sort
which means arrest of each other." Before the
Council was two weeks old many of its leading
members had found their way to prison. Dissensions
had broken out in its midst, and the stronger
victimized the weaker.</p>

<p>By April 7 a personage calling himself General
Cluseret had, as some one expressed it, "swallowed
up the Commune." He called himself an American,
and had been in the Union service in the
American civil war, but no one knew where he was
born. He had served in the Chasseurs d'Afrique
and in the Papal Zouaves, and after the fall of the
Commune escaped from Paris and became a general
of the Fenians, nearly capturing Chester Castle
in their service.</p>

<p>This man became absolute dictator over the revolted
city, with its two million of inhabitants; yet
after three weeks of this dictatorial rule his star
declined and he found himself in prison at Mazas,
to which he had sent so many others.</p>

<p>Leaving these details for the present, we must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
return to the war, which was soon in full blast.
The assault of April 4 repulsed, the guns of Fort
Var&eacute;lien were opened upon the city and the second
bombardment of Paris in that memorable year
began. The guns of its friends were more destructive
than those of its foes, the forts taking part in
the bombardment being much nearer the centre of
the city. Their shells damaged the Arch of Triumph,
which the Prussians had spared; they fell
alike on homes, public buildings and churches;
alike on men, women and children, friend and foe.</p>

<p>Under order of General Cluseret, the dictator of
the Commune, every man was ordered to take part
in the defence of the city. His neighbors were required
to see that he did so and to arrest him if he
showed a disposition to decline. For the seventy-three
days that the power of the Commune lasted
Paris was a veritable pandemonium, the fighting,
the arrests, the bombardment keeping the excitement
at an intense pitch. The people deserted the
streets, which were silent and empty, except for the
soldiers of the Commune&mdash;a disorderly crew in
motley uniforms&mdash;the movement of ammunition
wagons, and the other scenes incident to a state of
war. But the usual swarming life of Paris had
vanished. There was no movement, scarcely any
sound. The shop-windows were shut, many of
them boarded up, red flags hanging from a few, but
as a rule the very buildings seemed dead.</p>

<p>This is the story told by one observer, but another&mdash;perhaps
at a different period of the bombardment&mdash;speaks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
of well-dressed people "loitering in
the boulevards as if nothing were going on. The
caf&eacute;s, indeed, were ordered to close their doors at
midnight, but behind closed shutters went on gambling,
drinking and debauchery. After spending a
riotous night, fast men and women considered it a
joke to drive out to the Arch of Triumph and see
how the fight was going on."</p>

<p>On the 9th of April the army of Versailles began
to make active assaults upon the forts held by the
soldiers of the Commune, and with such effect that
confusion and dismay quickly pervaded its councils.
As the struggle went on the fury and spirit of retaliation
of the insurgents increased. New hostages
were arrested, the palace of the archbishop was
pillaged, and in the first week of May the destruction
of the house of M. Thiers, the president of the
republic, was decreed. It was a beautiful mansion,
filled with objects of art and valuable documents
used by him in writing his historical works. Some
of these were removed, but most of them were consumed
by the flames. On the 12th of May the
Commune, now inspired by the spirit of destruction,
ordered the levelling of the famous column in the
Place Vend&ocirc;me, describing it as a symbol of brute
force and false glory.</p>

<p>This famous column, one hundred and thirty-five
feet high, formed on the model of Trajan's column
at Rome, had been erected by Napoleon I., cast from
cannon taken from his foes, and surmounted by a
statue of Napoleon in his imperial robes. On May
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
16 this proud work of art fell, being pulled down
with a tremendous crash by the aid of ropes
fastened to its upper part. It is pleasant to be
able to state that this fine work of art has been
restored. Its attempted destruction filled the army
of Versailles with a spirit of revenge, which led
them, on their entering Paris a few days later, to
deal with the insurrectionists with brutal and merciless
energy. They had other and abundant cause
for this feeling, as the reader will perceive in the
recital of the later deeds of the desperate Commune.</p>

<p>By the date now reached the army of order was
rapidly gaining ground. The fort of Vauves was
taken; that of Mont Rouge was dismantled;
breaches were opened in the barricades, and by the
20th of May the army was in the streets and fighting
its way onward against a desperate defence. The
carnage was frightful; Dambrowski, a Pole and the
only able general of the Commune, was killed;
prisoners on both sides were shot down without
mercy; there were barricades in almost every street
and these were hotly defended, the courage of despair
in their defenders making the progress of the
besieging army a slow and bloody one.</p>

<p>The rest of the story is all blood and horror.
The desperate leaders of the Commune determined
that, if they must perish, Paris should be their
funeral pyre. On the night of May 24 the city
became a scene of incendiary rage. The H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville
was in flames; the Palace of the Tuileries was
burning like a great furnace; the Palace of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Legion of Honor, the Ministry of War, the Treasury
were lurid volcanoes of flames; on all sides the
torch had been applied.</p>

<p>Not only these great public buildings, but many
private houses were consigned to the flames. All
the sewers beneath Paris had been strewn with
torpedoes, bombs, and inflammable materials, connected
with electric wires, and the catacombs in the
eastern quarter of the city were similarly prepared.
It was the intention of the desperate revolutionists
to blow up the city, but fortunately, before their
preparations were completed, the army of order was
in control and sappers and miners were sent underground
to cut the electric wires leading to these
mines of death-dealing explosives.</p>

<p>But the capture of the city came too late to save
the lives of many of the "hostages" whom the
Commune had sent to prison. Not content with
burning the architectural monuments of the city,
as the last effort of baffled rage they condemned
these innocent victims of their wrath to death. On
Wednesday, May 24, the venerable archbishop and
five others of the imprisoned priests were taken
from their cells and shot to death. On Thursday
fifty more, priests and others, were similarly
slaughtered.</p>

<p>A large number of captives remained shut up in
the prison of La Roquette, around which, on Saturday
the 27th, a yelling crowd gathered, thirsting for
their lives. They, knowing that their rescuers were
fighting within the city, determined to defend themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
and convert the prison into a fortress. Poiret,
one of the warders, horrified by what had already
been done, was the leader in the resolution, in
which he was joined by the Abb&eacute; Lamazan, who
called out:</p>

<p>"Don't let us be shot, my friends; let us defend
ourselves. Trust in God; he is on our side."</p>

<p>The <i>sergents de ville</i>, captives in the story below,
had made the same resolution. They had no arms,
but they barricaded the doors and resolved to defend
themselves from the murderous throng outside,
howling for their blood. Two guns and a mortar
had been brought by the mob to fire on the prison
and the moment was critical.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a lull in the uproar. Something
had taken place. In a few minutes more the
crowd broke up and dispersed, dragging away the
guns they had brought. Word had reached them
that the Council had fled from its headquarters to
Belleville and a sudden panic seized the mob. Yet
that night they returned, howling and cursing, while
a barricade near by was still held by the insurgents.
But with the early dawn this was abandoned, the
mob melted away, and soon after a batallion of
rescuers marched up and took possession of the
prison. The captives were saved. Their resistance,
seemingly so desperate, had proved successful. That
day, Sunday, May 28, ended the rule of the Commune.
The Versailles troops, who had been fighting
their way steadily from street to street since the
21st, completed their work, the whole great city was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
in their hands, and the rule of the Commune was
over.</p>

<p>The Commune had left devastation behind it.
On every side were smoldering ruins, including the
great municipal buildings, the law courts, and other
public edifices, two theatres, eight whole streets, and
innumerable private houses, while the dead bodies
of its victims lay where they had been shot down.
The soldiers, infuriated by the ruin which they
beheld on all sides, were savage in their revenge.
Every man seized whose hands were black with
powder was instantly shot, many innocent persons
perishing, since numbers had been forced to the
barricades. The story of what took place during
those bloody days of retribution is too long to tell,
and it must suffice to sum it up in the frightful
death roll of fourteen thousand persons&mdash;six thousand
of them killed in open fight, eight thousand
executed in bitter revenge.</p>

<p>The executions over, the prisons were filled to
bursting. Count Orsi tells us that six hundred
men were locked up in the wine cellars of Versailles,
forty-five feet underground. He himself,
falsely seized through the malice of an enemy, spent
ten days in this horrible place amid the scum of the
insurgents. As for the members of the Council
of the Commune, some escaped, some were executed,
others were transported to New Caledonia, a lonely
isle in the far Pacific&mdash;from which they were subsequently
freed when the hot blood of that year of
revengeful retribution cooled down.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus ends the remarkable story of that year of
war, insurrection, and devastation, the whole due to
the overweening ambition of one man, Louis
Napoleon, who wished to shine as a great conqueror.
The destiny of France lay in his hand alone. He
blindly decided upon war. The result was the
humiliation of France, the death of thousands of
her sons, the overthrow of her government, the
frightful saturnalia of the rule of the Commune,
and the loss to France of two of her provinces, those
of Alsace and Lorraine, and a war indemnity of
one thousand million dollars. Such terrors march
in the train of blind and unrestrained ambition.<br /><br /><br /></p>
